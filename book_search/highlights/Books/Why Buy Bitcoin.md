### Highlights

- Money solves the problem of transacting at greater levels of productivity and economic activity. It solves the problem of social scaling10 and allows ever-greater levels of specialization, surplus generation, and wealth creation. In short, money is a key enabler of the enrichment and advancement of society. It is therefore foundational to modern human civilization. This is why it is so shocking that few people understand what money is. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=302))
- The best money has nearly 100% monetary value and near zero value as either a consumption good or a capital good. Said differently, the best money is something that is useless as anything other than money. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=379))
- Many people argue that good money has an “intrinsic” or other industrial value, when in fact the opposite is true. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=381))
- In his excellent book, The Bitcoin Standard, Austrian school economist Saifedean Ammous divides the double coincidence of wants problem into three categories: (1) location, (2) scale, and (3) time. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=382))
- Econ 101 textbook, which defined money as (1) a medium of exchange, (2) a store of value, and (3) a unit of account. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=390))

- Printing money and lowering interest rates props up asset prices, which directly exacerbates the disparity in wealth between the very rich and the rest by further enriching those who already own assets. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=936))
- Once a form of money achieves status as money and accrues a monetary premium, it tends to maintain that monetary premium for a significant period of time as the social consensus around it attains a certain durability.

    - **Note:** Consensus makes money trustabe and viable
- Relative to other monetary metals such as silver and copper, the primary reason for gold’s long-term success seems to have been its very high stock-to-flow ratio.77 Most metals have stock-to-flow ratios of around one or less. That means that in a given year, the amount of stockpiled inventory of the metal is approximately equal to the amount that was produced over the course of the year. This implies that people consume the metal almost as quickly as it can be produced. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1259))
- Gold stands in stark contrast to “industrial” metals that have low stock-to-flow ratios. Because of its few industrial uses (it doesn’t get “used up”) and the fact that gold has been mined for thousands of years, above-ground stockpiles of gold are enormous compared to annual new production. Such annual production has not accounted for more than 2% of the existing above-ground stock since 1942.78 This means that gold’s stock-to-flow ratio exceeds one divided by 2%, which is to say that it exceeds 50.

- This huge stock-to-flow ratio means that incremental supply is extremely inelastic to price. If an increase in demand for the metal causes the price to rise in the short term, suppliers cannot flood the market with supply and crash the price. ([Location 1266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1266))
- Embedded in this dynamic is the underappreciated fact emphasized in Chapter 2 that the best money is something that is useless as anything other than money. Therefore, a commodity that has significant industrial utility actually makes a worse money than a thing that has little or no industrial utility. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1273))
- gold’s average monthly price volatility over the last 40 years measured by standard deviation of price change is 5.3%. For silver and copper, the figures are 10.1% and 10.7%, ([Location 1278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1278))
- The Federal Reserve uses inflationary seigniorage to regressively tax the poor more than the rich. It further subsidizes the rich by keeping interest rates artificially low, which raises the prices of investment assets (capital goods) that are owned primarily by the wealthy. It prices young homebuyers out of the housing market because they can’t scrape together ever-rising down payments on ever-rising home prices. And it threatens to lower interest rates ever further in a misguided effort to “stimulate” the economy, which only stimulates ever-increasing debt incurrence. A decade ago, endless money printing and financial repression would have appeared inexorable. But now we have a potential solution. It’s called Bitcoin.

- Bitcoin is the Internet-native solution for money. ([Location 1385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1385))
- My ability to send the same unit of currency to multiple people by copying it is known as the “double-spend problem,” and it has tormented digital money developers for decades. ([Location 1422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1422))
- banks have solved the double-spend program by functioning as the trusted third party that performs the action of debiting your account and crediting my account when you pay me. ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1425))

- Bitcoin as the Scarcest Money ([Location 1639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1639))
- Bitcoin, in contrast to the dollar, to gold, and to any other currency in the history of the world, is the hardest money ever invented—“hard” being the word international currency analysts, economists, and traders use to describe money that is hard to produce and therefore scarce. Its predetermined cap of 21 million bitcoins operates on a supply schedule as follows. ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1649))
- This characteristic of adjusting the mining difficulty in order to maintain the predictable supply of new bitcoins is one of the system’s key features. ([Location 1667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07XG2J3S9&location=1667))

- Early skeptics of the iPhone criticized it for not being a better phone than existing mobile phones (true) and for being a worse computer than a laptop or desktop (also true). But the iPhone wasn’t about just providing a better phone or computer and taking market share from existing phone and computer businesses. It was about creating an easy-to-use mobile device that enabled entirely new applications such as real-time geolocation and traffic-based mapping (Google Maps/Waze), text communication via social networks (Twitter) on-the-go peer-to-peer video communication (FaceTime), high-resolution photography anywhere/anytime (12-megapixel camera), and 24-7 on-demand taxi service (Uber and Lyft).
