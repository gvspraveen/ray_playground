### Highlights

- But objectively, my passion level moved with my success. Success caused passion more than passion caused success. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=299))
- You already know that when your energy is right you perform better at everything you do, including school, work, sports, and even your personal life. Energy is good. Passion is bullshit. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=310))
- Good ideas have no value because the world already has too many of them. The market rewards execution, not ideas. From that point on, I concentrated on ideas I could execute. I was already failing toward success, but I didn’t yet know it. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=338))

- This was my first exposure to the idea that one should have a system instead of a goal. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=564))

- goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don’t sometime in the future. A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run. ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=592))

- The most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness, eating right, pursuing your career, and still spending quality time with your family and friends. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=828))

- The way I approach the problem of multiple priorities is by focusing on just one main metric: my energy. I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all of the other priorities.

- Priorities are the things you need to get right so the things you love can thrive. ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1107))
- Show me someone who you think is always in a good mood and I’ll show you a person who (probably) avoids overexposure to sad forms of entertainment. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1127))
- Smiling makes you feel better even if your smile is fake. This is the clearest example of how your brain has a user interface. When you’re in a bad mood, the physical act of forcing a smile may trigger the feel-good chemistry in your brain that is associated with happiness.

- I’ve come to believe that success at anything has a spillover effect on other things. You can take advantage of that effect by becoming good at things that require nothing but practice. Once you become good at a few unimportant things, such as hobbies or sports, the habit of success stays with you on more important quests. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1183))
- A great strategy for success in life is to become good at something, anything, and let that feeling propel you to new and better victories. Success can be habit-forming. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1200))

- What is less obvious is that you don’t need to know CEOs and billionaires. Sometimes you just need a friend who knows different things than you do. And you can always find one of those. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1351))
- One of the best ways to detect the x factor is to watch what customers do about your idea or product, not what they say. People tend to say what they think you want to hear or what they think will cause the least pain. ([Location 1488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1488))
- The idea is that you can raise your market value by being merely good—not extraordinary—at more than one skill. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1545))
- Good + Good > Excellent ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1549))
- You can’t directly control luck, but you can move from a game with low odds of success to a game with better odds. ([Location 1626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1626))
- Luck has a good chance of finding you if you become merely good in most of these areas. I’ll make a case for each one, but here’s the preview list. Public speaking Psychology Business writing Accounting Design (the basics) Conversation Overcoming shyness Second language Golf Proper grammar Persuasion Technology (hobby level) Proper voice technique ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1672))
- Today when I see a stage and a thousand people waiting to hear me speak, a little recording goes off in my head that says today is a good day. I’m the happiest person in the room. The audience only gets to listen, but I get to speak, to feel, to be fully alive. I will absorb their energy and turn it into something good. And when I’m done, there’s a 100 percent chance that people will say good things about me. ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1723))
- When you understand the power of honest praise (as opposed to bullshitting, flattery, and sucking up), you realize that withholding it borders on immoral. If you see something that impresses you, a decent respect to humanity insists you voice your praise. ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1729))
- It’s hard to imagine any business or social activity that doesn’t require a basic understanding of how the human brain perceives the world. Almost any decision you make is in the context of managing what other people will think of you. We’re all in the business of selling some version of ourselves. Psychology is embedded in everything we do. ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1738))
- I went to Wikipedia to get a quick list of the psychological and cognitive traps that humans often fall into. Psychology is an immense field and well beyond the scope of this book. My point is to impress upon you how many useful nuggets of information are at your disposal, and most of them are free. ([Location 1806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1806))
- My experience with hypnosis completely changed the way I view people and how I interpret the choices they make. I no longer see reason as the driver of behavior. I see simple cause and effect, similar to the way machines operate. If you believe people use reason for the important decisions in life, you will go through life feeling confused and frustrated that others seem to have bad reasoning skills. The reality is that reason is just one of the drivers of our decisions, and often the smallest one. ([Location 1832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=1832))

- Politicians understand that reason will never have much of a role in voting decisions. A lie that makes a voter feel good is more effective than a hundred rational arguments. That’s even true when the voter knows the lie is a lie. If you’re perplexed at how society can tolerate politicians who lie so blatantly, you’re thinking of people as rational beings. That worldview is frustrating and limiting. People who study hypnosis start to view humans as moist machines that are simply responding to inputs with programmed outputs. No reasoning is involved beyond eliminating the most absurd options. Your reasoning can prevent you from voting for a total imbecile, but it won’t stop you from supporting a half-wit with a great haircut.

- I also learned that art composition for anything from a magazine cover to an oil painting to a PowerPoint slide should conform to a few basic templates. The most common is the L-shaped layout. You imagine a giant letter L on the page and fill in the dense stuff along its shape, leaving less clutter in one of the four open quadrants.

- Persuasive Words and Phrases Because Would you mind . . . ? I’m not interested. I don’t do that. I have a rule . . . I just wanted to clarify . . . Is there anything you can do for me? Thank you This is just between you and me. ([Location 2152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=2152))
- People tend to double down when challenged, no matter how wrong they are. A more effective way to approach a dangerous social or business situation is sideways, by asking a question that starts with “I just wanted to clarify .

- A lack of fear of embarrassment is what allows one to be proactive. It’s what makes a person take on challenges that others write off as too risky. It’s what makes you take the first step before you know what the second step is. I’m not a fan of physical risks, but if you can’t handle the risk of embarrassment, rejection, and failure, you need to learn how, and studies ([Location 2357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=2357))
- Given our human impulse to pick up the habits and energy of others, you can use that knowledge to literally program your brain the way you want. Simply find the people who most represent what you would like to become and spend as much time with them as you can without trespassing, kidnapping, or stalking. Their good habits and good energy will rub off on you. ([Location 2707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=2707))

- You can’t always quickly fix whatever is wrong in your environment, and you can’t prevent negative thoughts from drifting into your head. But you can easily control your body chemistry through lifestyle, and that in turn will cause your thoughts to turn positive, while making the bumps in your path feel less important.

- That brings me to the next important mechanism for happiness. Happiness has more to do with where you’re heading than where you are. A person who is worth two billion dollars will feel sad if he suddenly loses one billion because he’s moving in the wrong direction, even if the change has no impact on his ability to buy what he wants. But a street person will celebrate discovering a new Dumpster behind an upscale restaurant because it means good eating ahead. We tend to feel happy when things are moving in the right direction and unhappy when things are trending bad. ([Location 2762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=2762))
- Pessimism is often a failure of imagination. If you can imagine the future being brighter, it lifts your energy and gooses the chemistry in your body that produces a sensation of happiness. If you can’t even imagine an improved future, you won’t be happy no matter how well your life is going right now. ([Location 2774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=2774))
- When bad luck comes around, your reaction to it is a combination of how bad the luck is plus how prepared your body is for the stress. You can’t keep all bad luck from finding you, but you can fortify yourself to the point where the smaller stuff bounces off. Your mood is a function of chemistry in your body, and food may be a far more dominant contributor to your chemistry than what is happening around you, at least during a normal day.

- When tiredness sparks your hunger but you’ve had all the calories you need for a while, try eating peanuts or mixed nuts to suppress your appetite. Cheese also works, at least for that specific purpose. The fat in those foods acts as an appetite satisfier. Nuts and cheese have lots of calories, but you’ll find that suppressing your appetite at the expense of some extra calories is still a net gain if the alternative is to eat until everything in your kitchen is gone. ([Location 3109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=3109))
- The Healthy Eating Summary The Simple, No-Willpower Diet System Pay attention to your energy level after eating certain foods. Find your pattern. Remove unhealthy, energy-draining food from your home. Stock up on convenient healthy food (e.g., apples, nuts, bananas) and let laziness be your copilot in eating right. Stop eating foods that create feelings of addiction: white rice, white potatoes, desserts, white bread, fried foods. Eat as much healthy food as you want, whenever you want. Get enough sleep, because tiredness creates the illusion of hunger. If your hunger is caused by tiredness, try healthy foods with fat, such as nuts, avocados, protein bars, and cheese, to suppress the hungry feeling. If you’re eating for social reasons only, choose the healthiest options with low calories. Learn how to season your healthy-yet-bland foods.

- If you are young and you don’t have crushing responsibilities, you probably have everything you need to exercise regularly. But after a certain age, life transforms exercise from one of your highest priorities to the thing you give up first when things get busy, and that can literally be a death trap.

- Once exercise becomes habitual, you won’t need willpower to keep going because your body and brain will simply prefer it to being a couch spud. And your natural inclination for variety will drive you to do more stuff over time. ([Location 3301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00COOFBA4&location=3301))
- The model for success I described here looks roughly like this: Focus on your diet first and get that right so you have enough energy to want to exercise. Exercise will further improve your energy, and that in turn will make you more productive, more creative, more positive, more socially desirable, and more able to handle life’s little bumps.
