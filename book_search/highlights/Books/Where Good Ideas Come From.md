### Highlights

- When life gets creative, it has a tendency to gravitate toward certain recurring patterns, whether those patterns are emergent and self-organizing, or whether they are deliberately crafted by human agents. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=233))
- When we want to answer a question like “Why has the Web been so innovative?” we naturally invoke thoughts of its creators, and the workspaces, organizations, and information networks they used in building it. But it turns out that we can answer the question more comprehensively if we draw analogies to patterns of innovation that we see in ecosystems like Darwin’s coral reef, or in the structure of the human brain. We have no shortage of theories to instruct us how to make our organizations more creative, or explain why tropical rain forests engineer so much molecular diversity. What we lack is a unified theory that describes the common attributes shared by all those innovation systems. Why is a coral reef such an engine of biological innovation? Why do cities have such an extensive history of idea creation? Why was Darwin able to hit upon a theory that so many brilliant contemporaries of his missed? No doubt there are partial answers to these questions that are unique to each situation, and each scale: the ecological history of the reef; the sociology of urban life; the intellectual biography of a scientist. But the argument of this book is that there are other, more interesting answers that are applicable to all three situations, and that by approaching the problem in this fractal, cross-disciplinary way, new insights become visible.

- Every economics textbook will tell you that competition between rival firms leads to innovation in their products and services. But when you look at innovation from the long-zoom perspective, competition turns out to be less central to the history of good ideas than we generally think. Analyzing innovation on the scale of individuals and organizations—as the standard textbooks do—distorts our view. It creates a picture of innovation that overstates the role of proprietary research and “survival of the fittest” competition. The long-zoom approach lets us see that openness and connectivity may, in the end, be more valuable to innovation than purely competitive mechanisms.

- Good ideas may not want to be free, but they do want to connect, fuse, recombine. They want to reinvent themselves by crossing conceptual borders. They want to complete each other as much as they want to compete. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=279))
- Good ideas are not conjured out of thin air; they are built out of a collection of existing parts, the composition of which expands (and, occasionally, contracts) over time. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=414))
- The trick is to figure out ways to explore the edges of possibility that surround you. This can be as simple as changing the physical environment you work in, or cultivating a specific kind of social network, or maintaining certain habits in the way you seek out and store information.

- innovative environments are better at helping their inhabitants explore the adjacent possible, because they expose a wide and diverse sample of spare parts—mechanical or conceptual—and they encourage novel ways of recombining those parts. Environments that block or limit those new combinations—by punishing experimentation, by obscuring certain branches of possibility, by making the current state so satisfying that no one bothers to explore the edges—will, on average, generate and circulate fewer innovations than environments that encourage exploration. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=491))
- The trick to having good ideas is not to sit around in glorious isolation and try to think big thoughts. The trick is to get more parts on the table. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=511))
- This is not the wisdom of the crowd, but the wisdom of someone in the crowd. It’s not that the network itself is smart; it’s that the individuals get smarter because they’re connected to the network. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=673))
- Dunbar’s research suggests one vaguely reassuring thought: even with all the advanced technology of a leading molecular biology lab, the most productive tool for generating good ideas remains a circle of humans at a table, talking shop. The lab meeting creates an environment where new combinations can occur, where information can spill over from one project to another. When you work alone in an office, peering into a microscope, your ideas can get trapped in place, stuck in your own initial biases. The social flow of the group conversation turns that private solid state into a liquid network. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=715))
- A metropolis shares one key characteristic with the Web: both environments are dense, liquid networks where information easily flows along multiple unpredictable paths. ([Location 841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=841))
- most great ideas come into the world half-baked, more hunch than revelation. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=843))
- disappears. So part of the secret of hunch cultivation is simple: write everything down. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=943))
- Being right keeps you in place. Being wrong forces you to explore. ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=1557))
- Even the creative arts evolve via stacked platforms. This may seem surprising, given how readily we draw upon the image of the private artistic genius, holed up in his study, conjuring a whole new world in his head from scratch. ([Location 2176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=2176))
- Government bureaucracies have a long and richly deserved reputation for squelching innovation, but they possess four key elements that may allow them to benefit from the innovation engine of an emergent platform. First, they are repositories of a vast amount of information and services that could be of potential value to ordinary people, if only we could organize it all better. Second, ordinary people have a passionate interest in the kind of information governments deal with, whether it’s data about industrial zoning, health-care services, or crime rates. Third, a long tradition exists of citizens committing time and intellectual energy to tackling problems where there is a perceived civic good at stake. And, finally, the fact that governments are not in the private sector means that they do not feel any competitive pressure to keep their data proprietary.

- communism. State-run economies were fundamentally hierarchies, not networks. They consolidated decision-making power in a top-down command system, which meant that new ideas had to be approved by the authorities before they could begin to spread through the society. Markets, by contrast, allowed good ideas to erupt anywhere in the system. In modern tech-speak, markets allowed innovation to flourish at the edges of the network. Planned economies were more like the old mainframe computer systems that predated the Internet, where every participant had to get authorization from a central machine to do new work.

    - **Note:** State-run economies = socialism
- It is in the nature of good ideas to stand on the shoulders of the giants who came before them, which means that by some measure, every important innovation is fundamentally a network affair. ([Location 2520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=2520))

- The promise of an immense payday encourages people to come up with useful innovations, but at the same time it forces people to protect those innovations. Economists define “efficient markets” as markets where information is evenly distributed among all the buyers and sellers in the space. Efficiency is generally held to be a universal goal for any economy—unless the economy happens to traffic in ideas. If ideas were fully liberated, then entrepreneurs wouldn’t be able to profit from their innovations, because their competitors would immediately adopt them. And so where innovation is concerned, we have deliberately built inefficient markets: environments that protect copyrights and patents and trade secrets and a thousand other barricades we’ve erected to keep promising ideas out of the minds of others.

- Does this mean we have to do away with intellectual property law? Of course not. The innovation track record of the fourth quadrant doesn’t mean that patents should be abolished and all forms of information allowed to run free. But it should definitely put the lie to the reigning orthodoxy that without the artificial scarcity of intellectual property, innovation would grind to a halt. There are plenty of understandable reasons why the law should make it easier for innovative people or organizations to profit from their creations. We may very well decide as a society that people simply deserve to profit from their good ideas, and so we have to introduce a little artificial scarcity to ensure those rewards. As someone who creates intellectual property for a living, I am more than sympathetic toward that argument. But it is another matter altogether to argue that those restrictions will themselves promote innovation in the long run.

- Go for a walk; cultivate hunches; write everything down, but keep your folders messy; embrace serendipity; make generative mistakes; take on multiple hobbies; frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks; follow the links; let others build on your ideas; borrow, recycle, reinvent. Build a tangled bank. ([Location 2794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003ZK58TA&location=2794))
