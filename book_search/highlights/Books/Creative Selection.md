### Highlights

- Start approximating your end goal as soon as possible. Maximize the impact of your most difficult effort. Combine inspiration, decisiveness, and craft to make demos. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079DVT6VP&location=813))
- significant part of attaining excellence in any field is closing the gap between the accidental and intentional, to achieve not just a something or even an everything but a specific and well-chosen thing, to take words and turn them into a vision, and then use the vision to spur the actions that create the results.

- Whiteboard discussions feel like work, but often they’re not, since it’s too difficult to talk productively about ideas in the abstract. ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079DVT6VP&location=1882))
- It’s not always easy to come to grips with objects or ideas and think about them until it’s possible to express why you like them or not, yet taking part in a healthy and productive creative process requires such reflective engagement.
