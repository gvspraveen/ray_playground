### Highlights

- The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. ([Location 41](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=41))
- The line between “inspiringly bold” and “foolishly reckless” can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight. Risk and luck are doppelgangers. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=375))

- But good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That’s when compounding runs wild.

- Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.

- 1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.

- You can be optimistic that the long-term growth trajectory is up and to the right, but equally sure that the road between now and then is filled with landmines, and always will be. Those two things are not mutually exclusive. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=706))

- Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=885))

- But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later. Its value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day purchase more stuff than you could right now.

- The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of insolvency. Keep this in mind when quickly judging others’ success and setting your own goals. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1047))

- The first idea—simple, but easy to overlook—is that building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate. ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1055))

- There are professional investors who grind 80 hours a week to add a tenth of a percentage point to their returns when there are two or three full percentage points of lifestyle bloat in their finances that can be exploited with less effort.

- Think of it like this, and one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1095))

- The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance—“unknowns”—are an ever-present part of life. ([Location 1417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1417))

- Sunk costs—anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be refunded—are a devil in a world where people change over time. They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves. It’s the equivalent of a stranger making major life decisions for you. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1598))

- The trick is convincing yourself that the market’s fee is worth it. That’s the only way to properly deal with volatility and uncertainty—not just putting up with it, but realizing that it’s an admission fee worth paying.

- Kahneman says the asymmetric aversion to loss is an evolutionary shield. He writes: When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains. This asymmetry between the power of positive and negative expectations or experiences has an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.

- Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant. ([Location 1928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1928))

- Independence, to me, doesn’t mean you’ll stop working. It means you only do the work you like with people you like at the times you want for as long as you want. ([Location 2222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2222))

- Every investor should pick a strategy that has the highest odds of successfully meeting their goals.

- Beating the market should be hard; the odds of success should be low. If they weren’t, everyone would do it, and if everyone did it there would be no opportunity.
