### Highlights

- Metabolism is a broad term that covers all of the work your cells do. The vast majority of this work involves pumping molecules in or out of cell membranes (their walls) and converting one kind of molecule into another.

- If the food you eat is processed, low in fiber, and easily digested, the carbs are digested quickly and the sugars rush into the bloodstream, creating a huge, steep spike in blood sugar. Those foods are said to have a high glycemic index, which is the rise in blood glucose measured two hours after ingesting a particular food, relative to the rise you’d experience from eating pure glucose. Foods that are harder to digest (more complex carbohydrates, fewer sugars, more fiber) take longer to digest and absorb, resulting in a long, low rise in blood sugar—and a low glycemic index.

- Fiber is a class of carbohydrate (there are many varieties of fiber) that our bodies can’t digest—at least, not on their own. These tough, stringy molecules are what give plant parts their strength and structure. Fiber from our food covers the intestinal walls like a wet knit blanket, forming a lattice-like filter that slows the absorption of sugars and other nutrients into the bloodstream. That’s why the glycemic index—the rush of sugar into the blood—is about 25 percent higher for orange juice, which doesn’t have much fiber, compared to a piece of orange, which does.

- Burning carbohydrates for energy is a two-stage process that we’ll discuss in detail below. Blood sugar that isn’t burned immediately is packed away into glycogen stores in your muscles and liver. Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate similar to plant starch. It’s easy to tap into when energy is needed, but relatively heavy because it holds an equal proportion of carbon and water (hence the term “carbohydrate”). It’s like canned soup: quick to prepare, but heavy and bulky because it’s stored with water. Humans, like other animals, have evolved hard limits on the amount of glycogen our bodies can hold. Once those buckets are full, blood sugar has to go somewhere else. And the only place left to go is fat. When your body’s energy needs are met and your glycogen stores are full, the excess sugar in your blood is converted to fat, as ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08D8JYQD6&location=642))
- Your brain weighs a little less than 3 pounds but burns about 300 kcal per day, accounting for 20 percent of BMR. ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08D8JYQD6&location=1249))
- Our metabolic engines shift and change to make room for increased activity costs, ultimately keeping daily energy expenditure within a narrow window. As a result, physically active people—whether it’s hunter-gatherers living today or in our collective past, or people in the industrialized world who exercise regularly—burn the same amount of energy as people who are much more sedentary. ([Location 2346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08D8JYQD6&location=2346))
- But more crucially, blaming obesity on slow metabolism gets the cause and effect of weight change completely backward. Our metabolism doesn’t dictate energy balance, it responds to energy balance. ([Location 2596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08D8JYQD6&location=2596))
- eating carbohydrate-rich foods, particularly those high in easily digested sugars, raises your blood glucose levels (blood sugar). In response, the pancreas produces the hormone insulin. Insulin has wide-ranging effects throughout the body, but one important role is to move glucose out of the blood and into cells to store as glycogen or to make ATP (Chapter 2). But there’s a limit on how much glycogen our body can hold, and insulin stimulates the conversion of excess glucose into fat and inhibits the pathways that mobilize and burn fatty acids (see Figure 2.1). Consequently, Taubes and other proponents of the carbohydrate-insulin model argue that carbohydrate-rich diets lead, paradoxically, to less fuel circulating in the bloodstream, as the glucose is converted to fat and stored away in our adipose tissue; the body responds as though it were starving, reducing energy expenditure and increasing hunger, promoting overconsumption.

- Modern diets overwhelm our hypothalamus and its ability to balance intake and expenditure in two ways. First, we’re bombarded with far more variety than our hunter-gatherer ancestors ever encountered. This variety sabotages our ability to judge intake by jumping from one set of reward neurons to another. Our brain shuts down the reward response for flavors it’s experiencing but leaves others exposed, a phenomenon called sensory specific satiety. The classic example is getting dessert at a restaurant even though you were completely stuffed from the main course. The main course is usually savory, lighting up the reward neurons for fat and salt. By the time you’ve finished it, your hypothalamus has successfully extinguished the reward of savory food; you couldn’t eat another bite. But dessert is sweet, and those reward neurons are open for business. Just the sight of the dessert menu starts the sugar reward circuits firing. Your hypothalamus is helpless. You laugh about having a separate stomach for dessert and order the crème brûlée. ([Location 3139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08D8JYQD6&location=3139))

- Exercise doesn’t change the number of calories you burn each day, but it does change how you spend them—and that makes all the difference. ([Location 3340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08D8JYQD6&location=3340))

- activities like jogging, playing soccer or basketball, backpacking, or bicycling that really get your heart rate up. Vigorous exercise gets the blood rushing through your arteries, triggering the release of nitric oxide, which keeps them open and elastic. Pliable vessels keep blood pressure low and are less likely to clog or burst, the catastrophes that cause heart attacks and strokes. Moderate activity (3 to 6 METS, things like a brisk walk, an easy bike ride, or gardening) is great, too. It helps with the trafficking of glucose out of the blood and into cells, and it is known to improve mood, stress, and can even help treat depression. Regular exercise also keeps you sharp mentally, slowing the rate of cognitive decline with age. Running and other aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain and causes the release of neurotrophins, molecules that promote the growth and health of brain cells.
