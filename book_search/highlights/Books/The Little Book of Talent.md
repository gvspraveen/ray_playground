### Highlights

- talent is determined far less by our genes and far more by our actions: specifically, the combination of intensive practice and motivation that produces brain growth. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=87))
- Small actions, repeated over time, transform us. ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=129))
- Think of your windshield as an energy source for your brain. Use pictures (the walls of many talent hotbeds are cluttered with photos and posters of their stars) or, better, video. One idea: Bookmark a few YouTube videos, and watch them before you practice, or at night before you go to bed. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=170))
- All improvement is about absorbing and applying new information, and the best source of information is top performers. So steal it. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=194))
- When given the choice between luxurious and spartan, choose spartan. Your unconscious mind will thank you. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=250))
- With these skills, we are not trying for Swiss-watch precision, but rather for the ability to quickly recognize a pattern or possibility, and to work past a complex set of obstacles. Soft skills are about the three Rs: Reading, Recognizing, and Reacting. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=279))
- When you learn hard skills, be precise and measured. Go slowly. Make one simple move at a time, repeating and perfecting it before you move on. Pay attention to errors, and fix them, particularly at the start. Learning fundamentals only seems boring—in fact, it’s the key moment of investment. If you build the right pathway now, you’ll save yourself a lot of time and trouble down the line. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=306))
- When you practice a soft skill, focus on making a high number of varied reps, and on getting clear feedback. Don’t worry too much about making errors—the important thing is to explore. Soft skills are often more fun to practice, but they’re also tougher because they demand that you coach yourself. After each session ask yourself, What worked? What didn’t? And why? ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=331))
- The key to deep practice is to reach. This means to stretch yourself slightly beyond your current ability, spending time in the zone of difficulty called the sweet spot. It means embracing the power of repetition, so the action becomes fast and automatic. It means creating a practice space that enables you to reach and repeat, stay engaged, and improve your skills over time. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=420))
- “One must develop an instinct for what one can just barely achieve through one’s greatest efforts.” ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=454))
- The other advantage of practicing daily is that it becomes a habit. The act of practicing—making time to do it, doing it well—can be thought of as a skill in itself, perhaps the most important skill of all. Give it time. According to research, establishing a new habit takes about thirty days. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=510))
- Whenever possible, create a vivid image for each chunk you want to learn. The images don’t have to be elaborate, just easy to see and feel. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=548))
- Develop the habit of attending to your errors right away. Don’t wince, don’t close your eyes; look straight at them and see what really happened, and ask yourself what you can do next to improve. Take mistakes seriously, but never personally. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=555))
- The more you pay attention to mistakes and fix them, the more of the right connections you’ll be building inside your brain. Visualizing this process as it happens helps you reinterpret mistakes as what they actually are: tools for building skill. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=561))
- Ask yourself: What’s the minimum space needed to make these reaches and reps? Where is extra space hindering fast and easy communication? ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=581))
- Super-slow practice works like a magnifying glass: It lets us sense our errors more clearly, and thus fix them. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=588))
- Removing everything except the essential action lets you focus on what matters most: making the right reach. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=605))
- This is not the finish—it’s the new starting line for perfecting the skill until it becomes automatic. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=610))
- Go too far so you can feel the outer edges of the move, and then work on building the skill with precision. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=628))
- Deep practice is about finding and fixing mistakes, so the question naturally pops up: ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=651))
- To learn something most effectively, practice it three times, with ten-minute breaks between each rep. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=661))
- What’s one key element of this skill? How can I isolate my accuracy or reliability, and measure it? How can I make it fun, quick, and repeatable, so I can track my progress? ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=675))
- Treat it as a way to rev the engine of your unconscious mind, so it spends more time churning toward your goals. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=739))
- A practice session should end like a good meal—with a small, sweet reward. ([Location 742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=742))
- If you’re like most people, your memories are less about what that person did than about the way that person made you feel. ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=751))
- We decide if we’re going to trust someone in the first few seconds of the interaction. This is why good teachers use the first few seconds to connect on an emotional level, especially on the first encounter. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=754))
- Master teachers and coaches don’t stand in front; they stand alongside the individuals they’re helping. They don’t give long speeches; they deliver useful information in small, vivid chunks. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=761))
- things you can see and touch and measure—and avoid adjectives and ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=779))
- Reachfulness is the essence of learning. It happens when the learner is leaning forward, stretching, struggling, and improving. ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=799))
- Repetition is the single most powerful lever we have to improve our skills, because it uses the built-in mechanism for making the wires of our brains faster and more accurate (see the Appendix, this page ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=829))
- truth—habits are tough to break. The blame lies with our brains. While they are really good at building circuits, they are awful at unbuilding them. Try as you might to break it, the bad habit is still up there, wired into your brain, waiting patiently for a chance to be used. ([Location 867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=867))
- This works because when you communicate a skill to someone, you come to understand it more deeply yourself. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=889))
- plateau happens when your brain achieves a level of automaticity; in other words, when you can perform a skill on autopilot, without conscious thought. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=912))
- that the best way past a plateau is to jostle yourself beyond it; to change your practice method so you disrupt your autopilot and rebuild a faster, better circuit. One ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=916))
- We all want to improve our skills quickly—today, if not sooner. But the truth is, talent grows slowly. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007JC1RM2&location=951))
