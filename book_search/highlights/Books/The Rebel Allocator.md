### Highlights

- “First, for seventy-seven years now, I’ve tried to go to bed a little smarter than I woke up.  Constant improvement is the only way to succeed.  It makes what is difficult to achieve become inevitable.  Success is a few simple disciplines, practiced daily.  Failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated daily.” ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07J4ZZXMB&location=402))

- “There are three qualities you want: integrity, intelligence, and energy.  If you don’t have the first, the other two can kill you.  If you hire someone without integrity, you really want them to be dumb and lazy.” ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07J4ZZXMB&location=411))

- “It is remarkable how much long-term advantage I’ve found by trying to be consistently not stupid.  You should try it sometime.  Instead of aiming to be very intelligent, just don’t be a dumbass.  If you avoid most of the big mistakes, you don’t have to be that smart to succeed.” ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07J4ZZXMB&location=413))

- It should be taught:  Revenue minus PROFITS equal expenses.” ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07J4ZZXMB&location=629))
- “Humans evolved in a linear environment, so we’re not wired to appreciate the power of compounding. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07J4ZZXMB&location=825))
- “In order for a business to thrive, the value delivered to the customer, V, has to be greater than the price the customer is charged, P, which has to be greater than the cost of that good or service, C.  V is greater than P is greater than C,” ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07J4ZZXMB&location=887))
- “In general,” Mr. X continued, “there are three ways to make the brand triangle bigger.  Be the cheapest.  Be the most convenient.  Or be the best.  Good companies aim for at least one of those objectives.  Great companies find a way to achieve two.  Doing all three is a rarity.” ([Location 1077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07J4ZZXMB&location=1077))

- either have to be the lowest cost producer or build up a brand that lets you charge more if you want to earn higher returns.” ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07J4ZZXMB&location=1115))

- Advertising has two functions: make people aware of the product, and shift out that V straw and increase the perceived value a customer experiences.  If you can nudge V out farther than the cost required, I’d consider that to be a sound strategic expense.

    - **Note:** effective ad should not be focussed heavily on next transaction alone. It should focus on increasing perceived value for consumer. That way you get price elasticity
- Successful capital allocation means converting inputs like money, materials, energy, ideas, human effort, into more valuable outputs.  It’s that transformation process.” ([Location 2889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07J4ZZXMB&location=2889))
- “I view capital as goods, both tangible and intangible, that were previously produced that aren’t directly satisfying a human need yet.  Capital is whatever bits, atoms, or energy that are available to eventually produce something that delights a customer.

- Simple models thrive when… - the problem is ill-structured and complex. - the information is incomplete, ambiguous, and changing. - the goals are ill-defined, shifting, or competing. - the stress is high, due to time constraints and/or high stakes. - decisions rely upon an interaction with others.
