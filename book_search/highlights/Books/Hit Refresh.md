### Highlights

- Innovation was being replaced by bureaucracy. Teamwork was being replaced by internal politics. We were falling behind. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=272))
- We had to meet the customers where they were and, more importantly, we needed to ensure that we viewed our opportunity not through a rearview mirror, but with a more future-oriented perspective. We ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01HOT5SQA&location=1005))
- A leader must see the external opportunities and the internal capability and culture—and all of the connections among them—and respond to them before they become obvious parts of the conventional wisdom.

- Education plus innovation, applied broadly across the economy and especially in sectors where the country or region has a comparative advantage, multiplied by the intense use of technology, over time, produces economic growth and productivity.
