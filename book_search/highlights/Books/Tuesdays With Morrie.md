### Highlights

- How can you ever be prepared to die? “Do what the Buddhists do. Every day, have a little bird on your shoulder that asks, ‘Is today the day? Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?’ ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEGMAU&location=929))

- continued, “most of us all walk around as if we’re sleepwalking. We really don’t experience the world fully, because we’re half-asleep, doing things we automatically think we have to do.” And facing death changes all that? “Oh, yes. You strip away all that stuff and you focus on the essentials. When you realize you are going to die, you see everything much differently. He sighed. “Learn how to die, and you learn how to live.” ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEGMAU&location=946))

- “Money is not a substitute for tenderness, and power is not a substitute for tenderness. I can tell you, as I’m sitting here dying, when you most need it, neither money nor power will give you the feeling you’re looking for, no matter how much of them you have.” ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEGMAU&location=1362))
- “Mitch, if you’re trying to show off for people at the top, forget it. They will look down at you anyhow. And if you’re trying to show off for people at the bottom, forget it. They will only envy you. Status will get you nowhere. Only an open heart will allow you to float equally between everyone.” ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEGMAU&location=1390))
- “People are only mean when they’re threatened,” he said later that day, “and that’s what our culture does. That’s what our economy does. Even people who have jobs in our economy are threatened, because they worry about losing them. And when you get threatened, you start looking out only for yourself. You start making money a god. It is all part of this culture.” ([Location 1660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEGMAU&location=1660))
- “In the beginning of life, when we are infants, we need others to survive, right? And at the end of life, when you get like me, you need others to survive, right?” His voice dropped to a whisper. “But here’s the secret: in between, we need others as well.” ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEGMAU&location=1692))
- “Death ends a life, not a relationship.” ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SEGMAU&location=1861))
