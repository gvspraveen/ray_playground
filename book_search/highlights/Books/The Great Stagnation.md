### Highlights

- We all develop a set of wage expectations and demands on the expectation that revenue streams in our economy will be fairly healthy. We set our retirement plans and savings and government old-age and transfer programs on the same basis. We develop expectations for our children and their prospects, again on a set of assumptions about future revenue streams. Basically, we have a collective historical memory that technological progress brings a big and predictable stream of revenue growth across most of the economy.   When it comes to the Web, those assumptions are turning out to be wrong or misleading. The revenueintensive sectors of our economy have been slowing down, and the big technological gains are coming in revenue-deficient sectors. To put it simply, only after 500 million members, and in very recent times, did the debate stop over whether Facebook can make a lot of money.   There ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H0M8QS&location=493))
- From the American right, tax cuts are one way to raise incomes immediately, and so politicians market tax cuts to voters. Shortsighted voters usually favor tax cuts without corresponding spending cuts. So, in the short run, real incomes will be higher, but we’re just running up debt and postponing and indeed intensifying our dissatisfaction. In the longer run, the bills come due, debts loom, and either real incomes must contract again or further tax cuts must be promised. Offering even more tax cuts only extends the basic dynamic and worsens the problem in the longer run. Tax cuts without spending cuts simply do not work, and yet politicians are driven to market them. Repeatedly. We are conducting fiscal policies that are unsustainable ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004H0M8QS&location=565))
- From the American left, the call for redistributing income will get louder as the Great Stagnation continues. Taking income from the rich and giving it to the poor is one way—again, temporarily—of boosting the real income growth of the poor and lower middle class. Like unfunded tax cuts, this remedy cannot be applied forever. Taxpayers in the top 5 percent of income already pay for more than 43 percent of the U.S. government, and taxpayers in the top 1 percent pay for more than 27 percent; at some point, taking more resources from the wealthy yields diminishing returns. Many of the Obama reforms, including much of the stimulus bill, and the health care bill, redistribute resources from higher-income groups to lower-income groups.
