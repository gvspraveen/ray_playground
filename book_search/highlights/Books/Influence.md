- Those who don’t know how to get people to say yes soon fall away; those who do, stay and flourish. ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=47))
- The principles—consistency, reciprocation, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity—are ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=68))
- Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=96))
- A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. People simply like to have reasons for what they do. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=148))

- Price alone had become a trigger feature for quality; and a dramatic increase in price alone had led to a dramatic increase in sales among the quality-hungry buyers. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=169))
- “civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=193))
- There is a principle in human perception, the contrast principle, that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are presented one after another. Simply put, if the second item is fairly different from the first, we will tend to see it as more different than it actually is. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=267))
- The rule says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=352))
- Quite simply, a half century later, against all countervailing forces, obligation triumphed. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=387))
- It is to those lengths that we will often be taken and, in the process, be “taken” by individuals who stand to gain from our ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=392))
- The rule for reciprocity was so strong that it simply overwhelmed the influence of a factor—liking for the requester—that normally affects the decision to comply. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=422))
- Think of the implications. People we might ordinarily dislike—unsavory or unwelcome sales operators, disagreeable acquaintances, representatives of strange or unpopular organizations—can greatly increase the chance that we will do what they wish merely by providing us with a small favor prior to their requests. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=424))
- The reciprocity rule that empowers their tactic is too strong—and socially beneficial—for us to want to violate it. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=461))
- The beauty of the free sample, however, is that it is also a gift and, as such, can engage the reciprocity rule. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=490))
- “There is an obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay.” ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=549))
- Most of us find it highly disagreeable to be in a state of obligation. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=615))
- Another consequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=649))
- Suppose you want me to agree to a certain request. One way to increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down. Then, after I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along. Provided that you have structured your requests skillfully, I should view your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own, the only one I would have immediately open to me—compliance with your second request. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=674))
- The truly gifted negotiator, then, is one whose initial position is exaggerated enough to allow for a series of reciprocal concessions that will yield a desirable final offer from the opponent, ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=713))
- One of the beauties of this tactic is that by first requesting ten dollars and then retreating to five dollars, I will have simultaneously engaged the force of the reciprocity rule and the contrast principle. Not only will my five-dollar request be viewed as a concession to be reciprocated, it will also look to you like a smaller request than if I had just asked for it straightaway. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=746))
- is a little-known pair of positive by-products of the act of concession: feelings of greater responsibility for, and satisfaction with, the arrangement. It is this set of sweet side effects that enables the technique to move its victims to fulfill their agreements and to engage in further such agreements. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=842))
- the rejection-then-retreat technique causes its targets to live up to their agreements with such astounding frequency. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=864))
- Since the tactic uses a concession to bring about compliance, the victim is likely to feel more satisfied with the arrangement as a result. And it stands to reason that people who are satisfied with a given arrangement are more likely to be willing to agree to further such arrangements. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=872))
- It is, quite simply, our nearly obsessive desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=972))
- They simply convinced themselves that they had made the right choice and, no doubt, felt better about it ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=978))
- Indeed, we all fool ourselves from time to time in order to keep our thoughts and beliefs consistent with what we have already done or decided. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=994))
- a high degree of consistency is normally associated with personal and intellectual strength. It ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1012))
- But because it is so typically in our best interests to be consistent, we easily fall into the habit of being automatically so, even in situations where it is not the sensible way to be. When it occurs unthinkingly, consistency can be disastrous. Nonetheless, even blind consistency has its attractions. ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1019))
- It is not hard to understand, then, why automatic consistency is a difficult reaction to curb. It offers us a way to evade the rigors of continuing thought. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1028))
- If, as it appears, automatic consistency functions as a shield against thought, it should not be surprising that such consistency can also be exploited by those who would prefer that we not think too much in response to their requests for our compliance. ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1078))
- The tactic of starting with a little request in order to gain eventual compliance with related larger requests has a name: the foot-in-the-door technique. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1221))

- What may occur is a change in the person’s feelings about getting involved or taking action. Once he has agreed to a request, his attitude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who does this sort of thing, who agrees to requests made by strangers, who takes action on things he believes in, who cooperates with good causes.30 What the Freedman and Fraser findings tell us, then, is to be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests. Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger requests, it can also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors that are only remotely connected to the little one we did earlier. It’s this second, general kind of influence concealed within small commitments that scares me. ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1247))

- Notice that all of the foot-in-the-door experts seem to be excited about the same thing: You can use small commitments to manipulate a person’s self-image; you can use them to turn citizens into “public servants,” prospects into “customers,” prisoners into “collaborators.” And once you’ve got a man’s self-image where you want it, he should comply naturally with a whole range of your requests that are consistent with this view of himself. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1263))
- Whenever one takes a stand that is visible to others, there arises a drive to maintain that stand in order to look like a consistent person. ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1375))

- Yet another reason that written commitments are so effective is that they require more work than verbal ones. And the evidence is clear that the more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater is its ability to influence the attitudes of the person who made it. ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1427))
- “persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort.” ([Location 1505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1505))
- A large reward is one such external pressure. It may get us to perform a certain action, but it won’t get us to accept inner responsibility for the act. Consequently, we won’t feel committed to it. The same is true of a strong threat; it may motivate immediate compliance, but it is unlikely to produce long-term commitment. ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1574))
- All this has important implications for rearing children. It suggests that we should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truly to believe in. Such pressures will probably produce temporary compliance with our wishes. However, if we want more than just that, if we want the children to believe in the correctness of what they have done, if we want them to continue to perform the desired behavior when we are not present to apply those outside pressures, then we must somehow arrange for them to accept inner responsibility for the actions we want them to take. ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1576))
- undergird choices we have committed ourselves to, an exploitative individual can offer us an inducement for making such a choice, and ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1647))
- Although consistency is generally good, even vital, there is a foolish, rigid variety to be shunned. It is this tendency to be automatically and unthinkingly consistent that Emerson referred to. And it is this tendency that we must be wary of, for it lays us open to the maneuvers of those who want to exploit the mechanical commitment ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1743))
- The first sort of signal is easy to recognize. It occurs right in the pit of our stomachs when we realize we are trapped into complying with a request we know we don’t want to perform. ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1752))

- This tactic has become the perfect counterattack for me. Whenever my stomach tells me I would be a sucker to comply with a request merely because doing so would be consistent with some prior commitment I was tricked into, I relay that message to the requester. I don’t try to deny the importance of consistency; I just point out the absurdity of foolish consistency. Whether, in response, the requester shrinks away guiltily or retreats in bewilderment, I am content. I have won; an exploiter has lost. ([Location 1801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1801))
- I needed to determine whether those reasons were genuine or mere justifications for my decision to stop there. So I asked myself the crucial question, “Knowing what I know about the real price of this gasoline, if I could go back in time, would I make the same choice again?” Concentrating on the first burst of impression I sensed, the answer was clear and unqualified. I would have driven right past. I wouldn’t even have slowed down. I knew then that without the price advantage, those other reasons would not have brought me there. They hadn’t created the decision; the decision had created them. ([Location 1861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1861))
- Where all think alike, no one thinks very much. ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1898))
- influence: the principle of social proof. It states that one means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct. ([Location 1926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1926))
- “fastest-growing” or “largest-selling” because they don’t have to convince us directly that the product is good, they need only say that many others think so, which seems proof enough. ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1958))
- “Since 95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer.” ([Location 1964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1964))
- apparently the principle of social proof works best when the proof is provided by the actions of a lot of other people.49 ([Location 1976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=1976))
- The principle of social proof says so: The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more the idea will be correct. ([Location 2132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2132))
- In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct. ([Location 2140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2140))
- We have already explored one of those conditions: uncertainty. Without question, when people are uncertain, they are more likely to use others’ actions to decide how they themselves should act. ([Location 2316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2316))
- But, in addition, there is another important working condition: similarity. The principle of social proof operates most powerfully when we are observing the behavior of people just like us. ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2317))
- We will use the actions of others to decide on proper behavior for ourselves, especially when we view those others as similar to ourselves. ([Location 2340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2340))
- No leader can hope to persuade, regularly and single-handedly, all the members of the group. A forceful leader can reasonably expect, however, to persuade some sizable proportion of group members. Then the raw information that a substantial number of group members has been convinced can, by itself, convince the rest. Thus the most influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group conditions to allow the principle of social proof to work maximally in their favor. ([Location 2532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2532))
- There are two types of situation in which incorrect data cause the principle of social proof to give us poor counsel. The first occurs when the social evidence has been purposely falsified. Invariably these situations are manufactured by exploiters intent on creating the impression—reality be damned—that a multitude is performing the way the exploiters want us to perform. The canned laughter of TV comedy shows, which we have already discussed, is one variety of faked data of this sort. But there is a great deal more; and much of the fakery is strikingly obvious. ([Location 2558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2558))
- In addition to the times when social evidence is deliberately faked, there is another time when the principle of social proof will regularly steer us wrong. In such an instance, an innocent, natural error will produce snowballing social proof that pushes us to the incorrect decision. The pluralist ignorance phenomenon, in which everyone at an emergency sees no cause for alarm, is one example of this process. The best illustration I know, however, comes from a story of one of my ([Location 2636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2636))
- The patrolman’s account provides certain insights into the way we respond to social proof. First, we seem to assume that if a lot of people are doing the same thing, they must know something we don’t. Especially when we are uncertain, we are willing to place an enormous amount of trust in the collective knowledge of the crowd. Second, quite frequently the crowd is mistaken because they are not acting on the basis of any superior information but are reacting, themselves, to the principle of social proof. ([Location 2649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2649))
- The main work of a trial attorney is to make a jury like his client. ([Location 2700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2700))
- Research has shown that we automatically assign to good-looking individuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence. ([Location 2767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2767))

- Other experiments have demonstrated that attractive people are more likely to obtain help when in need and are more persuasive in changing the opinions of an audience. ([Location 2784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2784))
- We like people who are similar to us. This fact seems to hold true whether the similarity is in the area of opinions, personality traits, background, or life-style. ([Location 2800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2800))
- Several studies have demonstrated that we are more likely to help those who dress like us. ([Location 2802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2802))
- Another way requesters can manipulate similarity to increase liking and compliance is to claim that they have backgrounds and interests similar to ours. ([Location 2809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2809))
- So, often in terms of flattery or simple claims of affinity, we hear positive estimation from people who want something from us. ([Location 2825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=2825))
- An innocent association with either bad things or good things will influence how people feel about us. ([Location 3074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=3074))
- Weathermen pay price for nature’s curve balls ([Location 3076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=3076))
- The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost. ([Location 3803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=3803))
- The idea of potential loss plays a large role in human decision making. In fact, people seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value. ([Location 3827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=3827))
- With the scarcity principle operating so powerfully on the worth we assign things, it is natural that compliance professionals ([Location 3841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=3841))
- A variant of the deadline tactic is much favored by some face-to-face, high-pressure sellers because it carries the purest form of decision deadline: right now. ([Location 3905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=3905))
- So when increasing scarcity—or anything else—interferes with our prior access to some item, we will react against the interference by wanting and trying to possess the item more than before.107 ([Location 3933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=3933))
- It is easy enough to feel properly warned against scarcity pressures; but it is substantially more difficult to act on that warning. ([Location 4257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=4257))
- Whenever we confront the scarcity pressures surrounding some item, we must also confront the question of what it is we want from the ([Location 4280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=4280))
- If the answer is that we want the thing for the social, economic, or psychological benefits of possessing something rare, then, fine; scarcity pressures will give us a good indication of how much we would want to pay for it—the less available it is, the more valuable to us it will be. ([Location 4281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=4281))
- But very often we don’t want a thing purely for the sake of owning it. We want it, instead, for its utility value; we want to eat it or drink it or touch it or hear it or drive it or otherwise use it. In such cases it is vital to remember that scarce things do not taste or feel or sound or ride or work any better because of their limited availability. ([Location 4283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=4283))
- That is why we employ the factors of reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity so often and so automatically in making our compliance decisions. ([Location 4380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002BD2UUC&location=4380))
- Unlike the animals, whose cognitive powers have always been relatively deficient, we have created our own deficiency by constructing a radically more complex world. But the consequence of our new deficiency is the same as that of the animals’ long-standing one. When making a decision, we will less frequently enjoy the luxury of a fully considered analysis of the total situation but will revert increasingly to a focus on a single, usually reliable feature of it.
