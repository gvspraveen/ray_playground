### Highlights

- Dhandho framework. To summarize: • Invest in existing businesses. • Invest in simple businesses. • Invest in distressed businesses in distressed industries. • Invest in businesses with durable moats. • Few bets, big bets, and infrequent bets. • Fixate on arbitrage. • Margin of safety—always. • Invest in low-risk, high-uncertainty businesses. • Invest in the copycats rather than the innovators.

- How do we know when a business has a hidden moat and what that moat is? The answer is usually visible from looking at its financial statements. Good businesses with good moats, like our barber, generate high returns on invested capital. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=1046))
- We are best off never calculating a discounted cash flow stream for longer than 10 years or expecting a sale in year 10 to be at anything greater than 15 times cash flows at that time ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=1076))
- The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.4 —Warren Buffett   Everything wears out eventually.

- The Dhandho investor only invests in simple, well-understood businesses. That requirement alone likely eliminates 99 percent of possible investment alternatives. Now, like Arjuna, we must be down to only reading up on simple, well-understood businesses. We must remain squarely in our circle of competence and not even be aware of all the noise outside the circle. Within the circle, read pertinent books, publications, company reports, industry periodicals, and so on. Every once in a while something about a business will jump out at you. If there appears to be some meat on the bone and you sense that the business might be underpriced compared to its intrinsic value, it is time to hone in. At that point, you need to become ultra-focused like Arjuna. All you should see is this one business. Shut everything else out. Nothing else exists on the planet. Drill down and see if it truly is an exceptional investment opportunity. Ask yourself if it fits in as a Dhandho buy. Most times it won’t be as cheap as you’d like or something will bother you and you’ll take a pass. In that case, go back to scanning the radar within your narrow circle. Again, when something jumps out, focus intently on it until it’s either rejected as an investment or passes all the Dhandho filters and you make the investment. Do not make the fatal mistake of looking at five businesses at once. Learn all you can about the business that jumps out for whatever reason and fixate solely on it. Once you’re at the finish line with your analysis, only then look at the broader circle of competence. ([Location 2582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L042Q4&location=2582))
