### Highlights

- “You better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don’t you won’t know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won’t know how to deal with them.” ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=332))
- Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning. 2. Know when not to have an opinion. 3. Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles. 4. Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside.

- Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=797))
- investments—wise people stick with sound fundamentals through the ups and downs, while flighty people react emotionally to how things feel, jumping into things when they’re hot and abandoning them when they’re not. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=887))
- Making a handful of good uncorrelated bets that are balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside without being exposed to unacceptable downside. ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=954))

- good habits come from thinking repeatedly in a principled way, like learning to speak a language. The good thinking comes from exploring the reasoning behind the principles. ([Location 1570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=1570))
- all human bodies work in essentially the same way, so do the economic machines in different countries. And just as physical diseases infect people without regard to nationality, so do economic diseases. ([Location 1592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=1592))
- I looked up to extraordinarily successful people, thinking that they were successful because they were extraordinary. After I got to know such people personally, I realized that all of them—like me, like everyone—make mistakes, struggle with their weaknesses, and don’t feel that they are particularly special or great. They are no happier than the rest of us, and they struggle just as much or more than average folks. Even after they surpass their wildest dreams, they still experience more struggle than glory. This has certainly been true for me. While I surpassed my wildest dreams decades ago, I am still struggling today. In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn’t come from achieving your goals, but from struggling well.

- But along the way I evolved, and now I am sharing these principles with you to help you evolve too. I realized that passing on knowledge is like passing on DNA—it is more important than the individual, because it lives way beyond the individual’s life. This is my attempt to help you succeed by passing along to you what I learned about how to struggle well—or, at the very least, to help you get the most out of each unit of effort you put in. ([Location 1911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=1911))
- Understanding, accepting, and working with reality is both practical and beautiful. I have become so much of a hyperrealist that I’ve learned to appreciate the beauty of all realities, even harsh ones, and have come to despise impractical idealism. ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=1967))
- we can see that perfection doesn’t exist; it is a goal that fuels a never-ending process of adaptation. If nature, or anything, were perfect it wouldn’t be evolving. Organisms, organizations, and individual people are always highly imperfect but capable of improving. So rather than getting stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending we’re perfect, it makes sense to find our imperfections and deal with them. You will either learn valuable lessons from your mistakes and press on, better equipped to succeed—or you won’t and you will fail.

- 1. Don’t confuse what you wish were true with what is really true. 2. Don’t worry about looking good—worry instead about achieving your goals.
  3. Don’t overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third-order ones.
  4. Don’t let pain stand in the way of progress.
  5. Don’t blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself. ([Location 2336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2336))

- Great planners who don’t execute their plans go nowhere. You need to push through and that requires self-discipline to follow your script. It’s important to remember the connections between your tasks and the goals that they are meant to achieve. When you feel yourself losing sight of that, stop and ask yourself “why?” Lose sight of the why and you will surely lose sight of your goals.

- Write down what your one big thing is (such as identifying problems, designing solutions, pushing through to results) and why it exists (your emotions trip you up, you can’t visualize adequate possibilities). While you and most people probably have more than one major impediment, if you can remove or get around that one really big one, you will hugely improve your life. If you work on it, you will almost certainly be able to deal successfully with your one big thing. ([Location 2549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2549))
- They crave praise and respond to criticism as an attack, even when the higher-level parts of the brain understand that constructive criticism is good for you. ([Location 2586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2586))
- when someone disagrees with you and asks you to explain your thinking. Because you are programmed to view such challenges as attacks, you get angry, even though it would be more logical for you to be interested in the other person’s perspective, especially if they are intelligent. ([Location 2601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2601))
- To be effective you must not let your need to be right be more important than your need to find out what’s true. ([Location 2605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2605))
- In my opinion, these two barriers—ego and blind spots—are the fatal flaws that keep intelligent, hardworking people from living up to their potential. ([Location 2634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2634))
- replace your attachment to always being right with the joy of learning what’s true. ([Location 2642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2642))
- Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and recognize that your ability to deal well with “not knowing” is more important than whatever it is you do know. ([Location 2648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2648))
- Be clear on whether you are arguing or seeking to understand, and think about which is most appropriate based on your and others’ believability. ([Location 2677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2677))
- Open-minded people are more curious about why there is disagreement. ([Location 2768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2768))
- Make being open-minded a habit. ([Location 2810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2810))
- Our differences weren’t a product of poor communication; it was the other way around. Our different ways of thinking led to our poor communications. ([Location 2935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=2935))
- A manager’s ability to recognize when outcomes are inconsistent with goals and then modify designs and assemble people to rectify them makes all the difference in the world. The more often and more effectively a manager does this, the steeper the upward trajectory. ([Location 4560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=4560))
- “There is no worse course in leadership than to hold out false hopes soon to be swept away.” ([Location 4855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B071CTK28D&location=4855))
