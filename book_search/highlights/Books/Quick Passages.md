### Highlights

- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) can decrease for a business that enjoys a network effect, which exists when the value of a good or service increases as more people use that good or service. This can happen even as the willingness to pay (WTP), the most a customer would pay for a good or service, increases. Lower CAC and higher WTP generally occur only when one network becomes dominant. The business that controls the network benefits from economies of scale on the supply-side, where costs decline as a function of sales, and the demand-side, where WTP increases as a function of sales.

- • **Increasing Willingness to Pay
  **Companies can increase willingness to pay (WTP) by earning a reputation of always placing the best interests of the customer first, reducing friction so as to create new opportunities, and considering carefully the needs of both the consumers and the intermediaries. Near customers are a group that has a WTP below the price of a company's offering. It is worth considering why these customers don't purchase a company's products and whether there are cost-effective ways to expand the total addressable market by gaining access to them.
  A central element of the theory of disruptive innovation is that there is a segment of the market that the incumbents are unwilling or unable to serve.
  Reducing search costs is another way to boost WTP. Experiments show that recommendation engines, popular on e-commerce and video streaming sites, have an effect on WTP. There is positive feedback between purchases and data. The more information a company has about purchase habits, the better it can customize recommendations, leading to further sales. Data about consumer preferences can be extremely valuable in an effort to lift WTP.
  **Complements**. A complement is a good or service that increases the WTP for another good or service.
  You see complements consumed together. Examples include smartphones and applications, printers and cartridges, and electric vehicles and charging stations.

- Five variables determine the rate of adoption. These include the following:
  • Relative advantage: How much better the new product is than the product that came before; 
  • Visibility: How visible the results of a product are to others; 
  • Trialability: How easy it is to try the product; 
  • Simplicity: How straightforward the product is to understand and use; 
  • Compatibility: The consistency of the new product with existing values, experiences, and needs.

- When you find a nascent but fast-growing space, dive in. Bezos had a high-paying job at quantitative hedge fund DE Shaw, but when he saw how fast internet usage was growing, he gave it up to start from scratch. It was a good bet. 
  Don’t be a purist. Most consumers don’t care whether your product is on the internet, web3, or offline. Those are tools, not value propositions. 
  Build something that literally can’t be built within the previous paradigm. “If you can do things using a more traditional method, you probably should do things using a more traditional method.” Bezos wouldn’t build a crypto project just to build a crypto project; he’d only build on the blockchain if it let him do something for customers that he literally couldn’t do otherwise. 
  Attention is a scarce commodity. Bezos told Higgins that attention was “the scarce commodity of the late 20th century.” It’s still the scarce commodity today, so his advice stands: “One of the ways that you can do that [capture attention] and it’s the way that we did it is by doing something new and innovative for the first time that actually has real value for the customer.”
  Focus obsessively on customer experience. If you’ve read anything about Amazon, you know this one. I won’t belabor the point. But keep it in mind: it’s not about the tech, it’s about what the tech can do for customers. 
  Optimism for the future. “What’s really incredible about this is that this is Day One. This is the Kitty Hawk stage of electronic commerce. The late 20th Century is just a great time to be alive.” Realizing that he was at the very beginning and taking a long-term view let Bezos make smart strategic decisions, like selling books despite the smaller market size, so that he was prepared to expand as the market grew.
