### Highlights

- The problem with solving one problem is that it usually creates a new problem that requires a new solution with its own new problems. This problem-solution-problem chain continues until eventually one of two things happens: either you fail to solve a problem and die, or you succeed in solving all the problems with a collection of both interlocking and independent innovation. This successful collection is what I call an Innovation Stack. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SZQN3P6&location=671))

- Customers new to a market hold few preconceptions, which is one of the great benefits of massively expanding an industry through innovation. Your new customers learn how to participate in the market from your way of doing business. This is a powerful advantage that influences both your Innovation Stack and your competitive position. The first group of customers are traditionally called early adopters, but in the world of Innovation Stacks calling them early adapters is more accurate. In fact, some innovation is only possible if new, adaptable customers board in a group, ([Location 2158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07SZQN3P6&location=2158))

- Southwest taught its customers to board in groups and to choose their own seats on the plane. Its customers got used to eating before the flight and not changing planes in some hub. They expected not to pay baggage fees or cancellation penalties. Southwest eventually even taught its customers to use Southwest.com by keeping its fares off all other websites. The Southwest passenger’s expectations are exactly what Southwest delivers, because Southwest custom built its market.
