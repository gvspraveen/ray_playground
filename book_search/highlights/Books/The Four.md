### Highlights

- The Four are engaged in an epic race to become the operating system for our lives. The prize? A trillion-dollar-plus valuation, and power and influence greater than any entity in history. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WP982HX&location=153))
- My experience in traditional firms is that anything new is seen as innovative, and the people assigned to it, like any parent, become irrationally passionate about the project and refuse to acknowledge just how stupid and ugly your little project has become.

- “Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it’s not an experiment.” ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WP982HX&location=555))
- Voice even further circumvents attributes that brands have spent generations and billions to build. With voice, consumers don’t know the price or see the packaging and are less likely to include the brand in their request. Fewer and fewer searches contain a brand name.88 Consumers are willing to price-compare several brands, and Amazon gives them just that opportunity. The death of brand, at the hand of Amazon, and in particular Alexa, can be foreshadowed in search queries. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WP982HX&location=716))
