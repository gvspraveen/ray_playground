### Highlights

- Identify businesses that can generate above-average profits for many years. 2. Wait until the shares of those businesses trade for less than their intrinsic value, and then buy. 3. Hold those shares until either the business deteriorates, the shares become overvalued, or you find a better investment. This holding period should be measured in years, not months. 4. Repeat as necessary. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=181))
- Buying a share of stock means that you own a tiny—okay, really tiny—piece of the business. 2. The value of a business is equal to all the cash it will generate in the future. 3. A business that can profitably generate cash for a long time is worth more today than a business that may be profitable only for a short time. 4. Return on capital is the best way to judge a company’s profitability. It measures how good a company is at taking investors’ money and generating a return on it. 5. Economic moats can protect companies from competition, helping them earn more money for a long time, and therefore making them more valuable to an investor.

- Moats depend less on managerial brilliance—how a company plays the hand it is dealt—than they do on what cards the company holds in the first place. To strain the gambling analogy further, the best poker player in the world with a pair of deuces stands little chance against a rank amateur with a straight flush. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=312))
- In my experience, the most common “mistaken moats” are great products, strong market share, great execution, and great management. These four traps can lure you into thinking that a company has a moat when the odds are good that it actually doesn’t.

- Unless a company has an economic moat protecting its business, competition will soon arrive on its doorstep and eat away at its profits. Wall Street is littered with the dead husks of companies that went from hero to zero in a heartbeat. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=332))
- In each of these cases, a dominant firm ceded significant market share to one or more challengers because it failed to build—or maintain—a moat around its business. So, the question to ask is not whether a firm has high market share, but rather how the firm achieved that share, which will give you insight into how defensible that dominant position will be.

- Being more efficient than your peers is a fine strategy, but it’s not a sustainable competitive advantage unless it is based on some proprietary process that can’t be easily copied. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=379))
- • A company can have intangible assets, like brands, patents, or regulatory licenses that allow it to sell products or services that can’t be matched by competitors. • The products or services that a company sells may be hard for customers to give up, which creates customer switching costs that give the firm pricing power. • Some lucky companies benefit from network economics, which is a very powerful type of economic moat that can lock out competitors for a long time. • Finally, some companies have cost advantages, stemming from process, location, scale, or access to a unique asset, which allow them to offer goods or services at a lower cost than competitors. In our experience at Morningstar, these four categories cover the vast majority of firms with moats, and using them as a filter will steer you in the right direction. We have thoroughly analyzed the competitive position of thousands of companies across the globe over the past several years, so these four characteristics have been boiled down ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=399))
- 1. Moats are structural characteristics inherent to a business, and the cold hard truth is that some businesses are simply better than others. 2. Great products, great size, great execution, and great management do not create long-term competitive advantages. They’re nice to have, but they’re not enough. 3. The four sources of structural competitive advantage are intangible assets, customer switching costs, the network effect, and cost advantages. If you can find a company with solid returns on capital and one of these characteristics, you’ve likely found a company with a moat.

- A brand creates an economic moat only if it increases the consumer’s willingness to pay or increases customer captivity. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=453))
- The big danger in a brand-based economic moat is that if the brand loses its luster, the company will no longer be able to charge a premium price. For example, Kraft used to absolutely dominate the market for shredded cheese until grocery stores introduced private-label products and consumers realized they could get pretty much the same thing—after all, processed cheese is processed cheese—for a lower price. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=495))
- The bottom line is that brands can create durable competitive advantages, but the popularity of the brand matters much less than whether it actually affects consumers’ behavior. If consumers will pay more for a product—or purchase it with regularity—solely because of the brand, you have strong evidence of a moat. But there are plenty of well-known brands attached to products and companies that struggle to earn positive economic returns.

- In short, if you can find a company that can price like a monopoly without being regulated like one, you’ve probably found a company with a wide economic moat. ([Location 529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=529))

- They key in assessing intangible assets is thinking about how much value they can create for a company, and how long they are likely to last. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=576))
- A well-known brand that doesn’t confer pricing power or promote customer captivity is not a competitive advantage, no matter how familiar people may be with it. And a regulatory approval that doesn’t create high returns on capital—think refiners—isn’t all that valuable. Finally, a patent portfolio that is too vulnerable to legal challenge, perhaps because it’s not diversified, or perhaps because the company has nothing in the pipeline as a follow-up, doesn’t constitute much of a moat. But if you can find a brand that gives pricing power, or a regulatory approval that limits competition, or a company with a diversified set of patents and a solid history of innovation, then the odds are good you’ve found a company with a moat. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008L045N4&location=577))
- 1. Popular brands aren’t always profitable brands. If a brand doesn’t entice consumers to pay more, it may not create a competitive advantage. 2. Patents are wonderful to have, but patent lawyers are not poor. Legal challenges are the biggest risk to a patent moat. 3. Regulations can limit competition—isn’t it great when the government does something nice for you? The best kind of regulatory moat is one created by a number of small-scale rules, rather than one big rule that could be changed.

- 1. Companies that make it tough for customers to use a competitors’ product or service create switching costs. If customers are less likely to switch, a company can charge more, which helps maintain high returns on capital. 2. Switching costs come in many flavors—tight integration with a customer’s business, monetary costs, and retraining costs, to name just a few. 3. Your bank makes a lot of money from switching costs.
