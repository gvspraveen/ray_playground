- “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1069))
- principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.” ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1069))
- “Charlie and I have not learned how to solve difficult business problems,” Buffett admits. “What we have learned to do is to avoid them. To the extent that we have been successful, it is because we concentrated on identifying one-foot hurdles that we could step over rather than because we acquired any ability to clear seven-footers.”5 ([Location 1595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1595))
- “where there is a strong likelihood that [they] will continue to do so.”6 He added, “I look at the long-term competitive advantage, and [whether] that’s something that is enduring.” ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1606))
- Conversely, a bad business offers a product that is virtually indistinguishable from the products of its competitors—a commodity. Years ago, basic commodities included oil, gas, chemicals, copper, lumber, wheat, and orange juice. Today, computers, automobiles, airline service, banking, and insurance have become commodity-type products. Despite mammoth advertising budgets, they are unable to achieve meaningful product differentiation. ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1619))
- Commodity businesses, generally, are low-returning businesses and “prime candidates for profit trouble.”10 Their product is basically no different from anyone else’s, so they can compete only on the basis of price—which, of course, cuts into profit margins. The most dependable way to make a commodity business profitable is to become the low-cost provider. The only other time commodity businesses turn a healthy profit is during periods of tight supply—a factor that can be extremely difficult to predict. ([Location 1623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1623))
- For gathering the necessary information, Buffett offers a few tips. Review annual reports from a few years back, paying special attention to what management said then about the strategies for the future. Then compare those plans to today’s results; how fully were the plans realized? Also compare the strategies of a few years ago to this year’s strategies and ideas; how has the thinking changed? ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1778))
- “When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that stays intact.” ([Location 1789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1789))

- 1. Focus on return on equity, not earnings per share. 2. Calculate “owner earnings” to get a true reflection of value. 3. Look for companies with high profit margins. 4. For every dollar retained, make sure the company has created at least one dollar of market value. ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1797))
    - **Tags:** #finance
- Buffett believes that cash flow numbers “are frequently used by marketers of businesses and securities in attempts to justify the unjustifiable and thereby sell what should be unsalable. When earnings look inadequate to service debt of a junk bond or justify a foolish stock price, how convenient it becomes to focus on cash flow.” ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1855))
- Instead of cash flow, Buffett prefers to use what he calls “owner earnings”—a company’s net income plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization, less the amount of capital expenditures and any additional working capital that might be needed. But he admits that owner earnings do not provide the precise calculation that many analysts demand. Calculating future capital expenditures often requires estimates. Still, he says, quoting Keynes, “I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.” ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1860))
- “Within this gigantic auction arena, it is our job to select a business with economic characteristics allowing each dollar of retained earnings to be translated eventually into at least a dollar of market value.” ([Location 1894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1894))
- In sum, then, rational investing has two components. 1. What is the value of the business? 2. Can the business be purchased at a significant discount to its value? ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1909))
- For Buffett, determining a company’s value is easy as long as you plug in the right variables: the stream of cash flow and the proper discount rate. In his mind, the predictability of a company’s future cash flow should take on a “coupon-like” certainty like that found in bonds. If the business is simple and understandable, and if it has operated with consistent earnings power, Buffett is able to determine the future cash flows with a high degree of certainty. If he cannot, he will not attempt to value a company. This is the distinction of his approach. ([Location 1924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1924))
- After he has determined the future cash flows of a business, Buffett applies what he considers the appropriate discount rate. Many people will be surprised to learn that the discount rate he uses is simply the rate of the long-term U.S. government bond, nothing else. That is as close as anyone can come to a risk-free rate. ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1929))
- If we make mistakes, he points out, it is either because of (1) the price we paid, (2) the management we joined, or (3) the future economics of the business. Miscalculations in the third instance are, he notes, the most common. ([Location 1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1970))
- “The market, like the Lord, helps those who help themselves,” Buffett says. “But unlike the Lord, the market does not forgive those who know not what they do.”31 ([Location 1985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=1985))
- “Investing is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.” ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=2003))
- know, in a commodity-like business, the actions of management are frequently the most distinguishing trait. ([Location 2913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=2913))
- “we would love to acquire businesses or invest in capital projects that produce no return for a year, but that could then be expected to earn 20% on growing equity.”42 ([Location 2972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=2972))
- “I find that a long-term familiarity with a company and its products is often helpful in evaluating it,” ([Location 2983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=2983))
- What had always troubled him was the difficulty of predicting their future cash flows. The constant disruption and innovation that is inherent in the industry made the life spans of technology franchises very short. ([Location 3055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3055))
- The information technology (IT) services industry is a dynamic and global industry within the technology sector, and no one is bigger in this industry than IBM.52 Information technology is an $800 billion plus market that covers a broad spectrum of services broken down into four different buckets: consulting, systems integration, IT outsourcing, and business process outsourcing. The first two, combined, contribute 52 percent of IBM’s revenues; 32 percent comes from IT outsourcing; and 16 percent from business process ([Location 3109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3109))
- outsourcing. In the consulting and systems integration space, IBM is the number-one global provider—38 percent bigger than the next competitor, Accenture. In the IT outsourcing space, IBM is also the number-one global provider—78 percent larger than the next competitor, Hewlett-Packard. In business process outsourcing, IBM is the seventh-largest provider, behind Teleperformance, Atento, Convergys, Sitel, Aegis, and Genpact. Information technology services are considered to be a growth-defensive industry within the technology sector. Whereas technology sectors like hardware and semiconductors are more cyclical in nature, the services sector benefits from relatively stable growth prospects. The IT industry is more resilient because its revenues are both recurring and tied to the nondiscretionary budgets of larger corporations and governments. So important are IT services that consulting, systems integration, and IT outsourcing are thought to have “moatlike” qualities. According to Grady Burkett, associate director of technology at Morningstar, the intangible assets like reputation, track record, and client relationships are the sources of a moat in consulting and systems integration. In IT outsourcing, switching costs and scale advantages create their own moat, ensuring that once IBM lands a customer, that customer is likely to remain a loyal client for many years to come. ([Location 3114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3114))
- Only one area, the relatively small business process outsourcing, is not protected by either the intangible assets or the cost of switching. According to Gartner, the world’s leading information technology research and advisory company, the total market for IT services is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 4.6 percent, from an estimated $844 billion in 2011 to $1.05 trillion in 2016. ([Location 3124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3124))
- The move away from hardware technology to consulting and software begun by Lou Gerstner and accelerated by Sam Palmisano transformed IBM away from the low-margin, commoditized part of the technology industry to the higher-margin, moat-protected business of consulting, systems integration, and IT outsourcing. ([Location 3129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3129))
- “If you are a know-something investor, able to understand business economics, and can locate five to ten sensibly priced companies that possess important long-term competitive advantages, conventional diversification makes no sense for you.”4 ([Location 3450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3450))
- “With each investment you make, you should have the courage and conviction to place at least ten percent of your net worth in that stock.”5 ([Location 3462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3462))
- “If I think there is a 90 percent chance of occurring and there is 3 points on the upside and there is a 10 percent chance that it will fall through and there is 9 points on the downside, then that’s $0.90 off of $2.70, leaving $1.80 mathematical expectation.” ([Location 3612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3612))
- The Kelly optimization model, often called the optimal growth strategy, is based on the concept that if you know the probability of success, you bet the fraction of your bankroll that maximizes the growth rate. It is expressed as a formula: 2p − 1 = x where 2 times the probability of winning (p) minus 1 equals the percentage of your total bankroll that you should bet (x). For example, if the probability of beating the house is 55 percent, you should bet 10 percent of your bankroll to achieve maximum growth of your winnings. If the probability is 70 percent, bet 40 percent. And if you know the odds of winning are 100 percent, the model would say: Bet it all. ([Location 3652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3652))
- The chain of thinking is the same. 1. Calculate probabilities. This is the probability you are ([Location 3710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3710))
- concerned with: What are the chances that this stock I am considering will, over time, achieve an economic return greater than the stock market? 2. Wait for the best odds. The odds of success tip in your favor when you have a margin of safety; the more uncertain the situation, the greater the margin you need. In the stock market, the margin of safety is provided by a discounted price. When the company you like is selling at a price that is below its intrinsic value, that is your signal to act. 3. Adjust for new information. Knowing that you are going to wait until the odds turn in your favor, pay scrupulous attention in the meantime to whatever the company does. Has management begun to act irresponsibly? Have the financial decisions begun to change? Has something happened to alter the competitive landscape in which the business operates? If so, the probabilities will likely change. 4. Decide how much to invest. Of all the money you have available for investing in the market, what proportion should go into a particular purchase? Start with the Kelly formula, then adjust downward, perhaps to a half-Kelly bet or a fractional-Kelly bet. Thinking about probabilities may be new to you, but it ([Location 3711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3711))
- is not impossible to learn how to use them. If you are able to teach yourself to think about stocks this way, you are well on your way to being able to profit from your own lessons. Recall Buffett’s purchase of the Coca-Cola Company in 1988. He invested one-third of Berkshire’s portfolio in the company. Coca-Cola was an outstanding business with above-average economics selling at a price substantially below intrinsic value. Opportunities like this do not often occur in the stock market. But when one does occur, those who understand probabilities will recognize it and will know what to do. As Charlie Munger puts it, “The wise [investors] bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the time, they don’t. It’s just that simple.”23 ([Location 3722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3722))
- “When the price of a stock can be influenced by a ‘herd’ on Wall Street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or the most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the market always prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently nonsensical.” ([Location 3944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=3944))
- We have to drop our insistence on price as the only measuring stick, and we have to break ourselves of the counterproductive habit of making short-term judgments. ([Location 4024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4024))
- “A prolonged suspension of trading in securities we hold would not bother us any more than does the lack of daily quotations for [Berkshire’s wholly owned subsidiaries]. Eventually our economic fate will be determined by the economic fate of the business we own, whether our ownership is partial [in the form of shares of stock] or total.” ([Location 4035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4035))

- “The market may ignore a business success for a while, but it eventually will confirm it.” ([Location 4044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4044))
- “The speed at which a business’s success is recognized, furthermore, is not that important as long as the company’s intrinsic value is increasing at a satisfactory rate,” ([Location 4062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4062))
- To help shareholders appreciate the value of Berkshire Hathaway’s large common stock investments, Buffett coined the term look-through earnings. Berkshire’s look-through earnings are made up of the operating earnings of its consolidated businesses (its subsidiaries), the retained earnings of its large common stock investments, and allowance for the tax that Berkshire would have to pay if the retained earnings were actually paid out. The notion of look-through earnings was originally devised for Berkshire’s shareholders, but it also represents an important lesson for focus investors who seek a way to understand the value of their portfolio when, as will happen from time to time, share prices disengage from underlying economics. “The goal of each investor,” says Buffett, “should be to create a portfolio (in effect, a company), that will deliver him or her the highest possible look-through earnings a decade or so from now.” ([Location 4066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4066))
- “For an ordinary individual, the best thing you already have should be your measuring stick.” ([Location 4083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4083))
- “If the new thing you are considering purchasing is not better than what you already know is available,” says Charlie, “then it hasn’t met your threshold. This screens out 99 percent of what you see.” ([Location 4085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4085))
- When a stock appreciates in price but is not sold, the increase in value is an unrealized gain. No capital gains tax is owed until the stock is sold. If you leave the gain in place, your money compounds more forcefully. ([Location 4128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4128))
- Do not approach the market unless you are willing to think about stocks, first and always, as part-ownership interests in businesses. Be prepared to diligently study the businesses you own, as well as the companies you compete against, with the idea that no one will know more about your business than you do. Do not even start a focus portfolio unless you are willing to invest a minimum of five years (10 years ([Location 4143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4143))
- would even be better). Never leverage your focus portfolio. An unleveraged focus portfolio will help you reach your goals fast enough. Remember, an unexpected margin call on our capital will likely wreck a well-tuned portfolio. Accept the need to acquire the right temperament and personality to become a focus investor. ([Location 4146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4146))
- “Investing is not a game where the 160 IQ guy beats the guy with the 130 IQ. The size of an investor’s brain is less important than his ability to detach the brain from the emotions.” ([Location 4161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4161))

- As Warren Buffett, his most famous student, explains, “There are three important principles to Graham’s approach.” The first is simply looking at stocks as businesses, which “gives you an entirely different view ([Location 4320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4320))
- than most people who are in the market.” The second is the margin-of-safety concept, which “gives you the competitive edge.” And the third is having a true investor’s attitude toward the stock market. “If you have that attitude,” says Buffett, “you start out ahead of 99 percent of all the people who are operating in the stock market—it is an enormous advantage.” ([Location 4322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4322))
- In fact, Kahneman and Tversky were able to prove mathematically that people regret losses more than they welcome gains of the same size—two to two and one-half times more. ([Location 4422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4422))
- In other words, the pain of a loss is far greater than the enjoyment of a gain. Many experiments have demonstrated that people need twice as much positive to overcome a negative. On a 50/50 bet, with precisely even odds, most people will not risk anything unless the potential gain is twice as high as the potential loss. ([Location 4424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4424))
- No one wants to admit making a mistake. But if you don’t sell a mistake, you are potentially giving up a gain that you could earn by reinvesting smartly. ([Location 4434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4434))
- He points out, “For owners of a business—and that’s the way we think of shareholders—the academic’s definition of risk is far off the market, so much so that it produces absurdities.”13 ([Location 4611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4611))
- “Diversification serves as a protection against ignorance,” explains Buffett. “If you want to make sure that nothing bad happens to you relative to the market, you should own everything. There is nothing wrong with that. It’s a perfectly sound approach for somebody that doesn’t know how to analyze businesses.” ([Location 4630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4630))

- I have written about Warren Buffett for over 20 years. Over that time period, I have not met anyone who has vehemently disagreed with the methodology outlined in The Warren Buffett Way. I have, however, met countless individuals who, although they wholeheartedly agree with Buffett’s writings, were never emotionally able to apply his lessons. This, I have come to believe, is the single most important key to understanding his success, and it is one part of the puzzle that has not been fully explored. In a word, Warren Buffett is rational, not emotional. ([Location 4666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4666))
- Speculators work in short-horizon periods and accept smaller returns. Investors operate over long-horizon periods and expect larger returns. ([Location 4770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4770))
- With so many people now speculating, the difficulty of winning short-term bets has gone up while the returns have gone down. The powerful magnet that has pulled so many people into becoming short-term speculators has left but a rarefied few to close the inefficiencies, the excess returns, of long-term investing. ([Location 4805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4805))
- he coined the term dysrationalia—the inability to think and behave rationally despite high intelligence. Research in cognitive psychology suggests there are two principal causes of dysrationalia. The first is a processing problem. The second is a content problem. Let’s look at them closely, one at a time. ([Location 4817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4817))
- The Warren Buffett Way are the ideas that “travel slowly” and that relate to “‘long-term’ business developments,” and thus are the basis for “long-term investing.” Let’s be clear: The slow-moving idea is not intellectually difficult to grasp, but it is more laborious than relying on the “straightforward and obvious.” ([Location 4857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4857))
- For years, psychologists have been interested in the idea that our cognition processes are divided into two modes of thinking, traditionally referred to as intuition, which produces “quick and associative” cognition, and reason, described as “slow and rule-governed.” Today, psychologists routinely refer to these cognitive systems as System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 thinking is where simple and straightforward ideas travel quickly. It takes little time and not much intellectual work to calculate a price-earnings ratio or a dividend yield. System 2 thinking is the reflective part of our cognition process. It operates in a controlled manner, slowly and with effort. Our “slow-moving ideas” that require “reflection, judgment, and special expertise” are housed in System 2 thinking. ([Location 4861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4861))
- Kahneman tells us activities that put demands on System 2 thinking require self-control, and continuous exertion of self-control can be unpleasant. If we are continually forced to do something over and over that is challenging, there is a tendency to exert less self-control when the next challenge arrives. Eventually we simply run out of gas. In contrast, “those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called ‘engaged.’ They are more alert, more intelligently active, less willing to be satisfied with superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions.”8 ([Location 4873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4873))
- System 2 thinking is serious thought. It is deliberate and requires concentration. System 2 thinkers are naturally patient. For System 2 thinking to work effectively, you must allocate time for deliberation and, yes, even meditation. You will not be surprised when I point out that the tenets outlined in The Warren Buffett Way are best suited for slow thinking, not the rapid-fire decisions common to System 1. ([Location 4905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4905))
- Psychologists who study decision making refer to content deficiency as a mindware gap. First articulated by David Perkins, a Harvard cognitive scientist, mindware is all the rules, strategies, procedures, and knowledge people have at their mental disposal to help solve a problem. ([Location 4911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4911))
- “A piece of mindware is anything a person can learn that extends the person’s general powers to think critically and creatively.” ([Location 4914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4914))
- “Rationality is essential when others are making decisions based on short-term greed or fear,” says Buffett. “That is when the money is made.” ([Location 4945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00FAMMZN8&location=4945))
