### Highlights

- There are, however, other options. Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career. Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback. Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn. Managers who want you to take their job someday. And most importantly, managers who help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus.

- 1-1s serve two purposes. First, they create human connection between you and your manager. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=166))
- Great managers notice when your normal energy level changes, and will hopefully care enough to ask you about it. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=169))
- Being an introvert is not an excuse for making no effort to treat people like real human beings, however. The bedrock of strong teams is human connection, which leads to trust. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=173))
- The second purpose of a 1-1 is a regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=178))
- Ideally, the feedback you get from your manager will be somewhat public if it’s praise, and private if it’s criticism. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=199))
- Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=201))

- Your manager should be the person who shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team’s goals, and helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work. The most mundane work can turn into a source of pride when you understand how it contributes to the overall success of the company. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=217))
- Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=309))
- A strong engineer may make a great mentor-manager to someone early in his career, but a terrible advocate-manager for someone who is more senior. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=319))
- Listening is the first and most basic skill of managing people. Listening is a precursor to empathy, which is one of the core skills of a quality manager. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=382))
- The best internships are those with a clear project. The trick to deciding on an intern project is that you want something specific but not urgent, something relevant to the team but also something that could be completed by an entry-level engineer in the span of, say, half the time that your intern will be there. So if he’ll be there for 10 weeks, give him a project you think would probably take a new hire about 5 weeks. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=422))
- creating clear, focused, measurable goals. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=550))
- It’s natural for humans to prefer activities they’ve mastered, so when you have to spend less time on your current talents in favor of learning new things, it’ll feel quite uncomfortable. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=716))
- Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly, that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth before diving in and seeing what happens. A degree of forethought, in places where you can reasonably make predictions ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=815))
- We think our management “gets” what we do as technologists. Just “read the code, man!” The software we live and breathe every day ought to seem obvious to anyone working in technology, right? But it is not. Technology managers hire the best people (hopefully), who solve very difficult problems. But they don’t “get” it all. I’ve always been surprised how grateful senior technical managers have been when I can explain some very basic modern ideas (e.g., what’s this NoSQL stuff all about, and why should I care?) to them in a nonthreatening and noncondescending way. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=838))
- Process czars struggle when they fail to realize that most people are not as good at following processes as they are. They tend to blame all problems on a failure to follow the best process, instead of acknowledging the need for flexibility and the inevitability of unexpected changes. They often get focused on easy-to-measure things, such as hours in the office, and miss the nuances that they fail to capture when focusing on the things that are easy to measure. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=993))
- The opposite of the process czar is not a manager who gives up on process completely, but rather someone who understands that processes must meet the needs of the team and the work. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1000))
- As with many of the manager pitfalls, an obsession with process can be related to a fear of failure and a desire to control things to prevent the unexpected. If you are honest and make it clear that it’s safe to fail and to be imperfect, ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1009))
- If one universal talent separates successful leaders from the pack, it’s communication skills. ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1041))
- Don’t forget to listen during all of this communication. Give others a chance to speak, and hear what they say. Practice repeating things back to people to ensure you understand them. Learn how to hear what someone says and rephrase it in your own words. If you aren’t a good note taker, you may need to become one. It doesn’t matter whether you choose to dive deep into technology, or become a manager — if you can’t communicate and listen to what other people are saying, your career growth from this point on will suffer.

- “new manager” is an entry-level job with no seniority on any front, but that’s the best mindset with which to start leading. ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1062))
- Having a clear set of expected goals for your new hires that you believe is achievable in the first 90 days will help you catch mishires quickly, and make it clear to you and to them that you need to correct the situation. Create a set of realistic milestones based on your prior hires, the current state of your technology and project, and the level of the person coming in. ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1110))
- Encourage Participation by Updating the New Hire Documentation ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1113))
- Regular 1-1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1137))
- One final piece of advice: try to keep notes in a shared document, with you the manager playing note taker. For each person you manage, maintain a running shared document of notes, takeaways, and to-dos from your 1-1s. This is helpful for you to keep context about what has happened, and is useful for remembering when and what feedback was given. It will also be an essential historical record to refer to when you’re writing reviews or delivering feedback. If you’re distracted by having a computer open in front of you during the meetings, just leave time at the end to add notes. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1231))
- Autonomy, the ability to have control over some part of your work, is an important element of motivation. This is why micromanagers find it so difficult to retain great teams. When you strip creative and talented people of their autonomy, they lose motivation very quickly. There’s nothing worse than feeling like you can’t make a single decision on your own, or feeling like every single piece of work you do has to be double- and triple-checked by your manager. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1272))
- If you’re managing a single team or two directly, you should know all of the details of the project status as part of your regular team processes (like morning standup meetings). Different details are important at different project stages. In the beginning and design stages of a project, you may want to be more involved in order to facilitate a good set of project goals or a good system design. When you’re close to a delivery date, progress details become more important, because there are more decisions to be made and those specifics convey much more actionable information.

- as a new manager, getting into the habit of continuous feedback is training you to pay attention to individuals, which in turn makes it easier to recognize and foster talent. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1348))
- As a new manager, you don’t have to jump into the deep end of coaching first thing. Many people respond better to praise than they do to corrective feedback, and you can use kudos to guide them to better behavior by emphasizing the things they’ve done well. ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1369))

- Set expectations appropriately before reviews are delivered. If someone is underperforming across the board, the review should not be his first time getting that feedback. Similarly, if someone has recently been promoted, you may want to prepare her for the fact that she will be reviewed based on higher standards. ([Location 1452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1452))
- One of the basic rules of management is the rule of no surprises, particularly negative ([Location 1542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1542))
- Creating a safe environment for disagreement to work itself out is far better than pretending that all disagreement does not exist. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1860))
- Don’t rely exclusively on consensus or voting. Consensus can appear morally authoritative, but that assumes that everyone involved in the voting process is impartial, has an equal stake in the various outcomes, and has equal knowledge of the context. ([Location 1862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1862))

- Am I holding back on giving my employee this feedback because he really was having a bad day and it’s just a one-off, or am I holding back because I’m afraid he won’t like me as a manager if I tell him? Be thoughtful about your behavior, and it’s unlikely that you’ll seek out unnecessary conflict. ([Location 1904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=1904))
- The popular doubling rule of software estimation is, “Whenever asked for an estimate, take your guess and double it.” This rule is appropriate and good to use when you’re asked for an off-the-cuff guess. ([Location 2032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=2032))
- see if it had achieved its goals? How well does your team understand ([Location 2069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XP3GJ7F&location=2069))
