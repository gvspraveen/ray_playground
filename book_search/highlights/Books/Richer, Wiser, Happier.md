- Any asset, however ugly, can be worth buying if the price is low enough. Indeed, Marks believes that “buying cheap” is the single most reliable route to investment riches—and that overpaying is the greatest risk. Thus, the essential question to ask about any potential investment should be “Is it cheap?” ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXCPW5&location=1184))
- “You better be scared—scared in the sense of acknowledging the possibility of bad things happening and being realistic about your own ability to withstand bad outcomes.” He warns against “macho” claims that we won’t mind if the stock market plunges: “What normally happens when it goes down a third is that people panic and they sell and they turn that downward fluctuation into a permanent loss, which is the worst thing you can do.” It’s vital, then, to be honest with ourselves about how much risk we can handle: “If you take on too much, it will overwhelm your emotional resilience and you will be forced to do the wrong thing ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXCPW5&location=1457))

We should never borrow to excess because, as Eveillard warns, debt erodes our “staying power.” Like him, we should avoid the temptation to speculate on hot stocks with supposedly glorious growth prospects but no margin of safety. And we should bypass businesses with weak balance sheets or a looming need for external funding, which is liable to disappear in times of distress.

- I think that people underestimate—until they get older—they underestimate just how important habits are, and how difficult they are to change when you’re forty-five or fifty, and how important it is that you form the right ones when you’re young.

- it’s the aggregation of marginal gains that’s so powerful. Moreover, the modest benefits generated by smart habits continue to compound over many years. ([Location 3051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXCPW5&location=3051))
- What we need is a selection of sensible habits that are directionally correct and sustainable—habits that give us a marginal advantage that will compound over time. ([Location 3055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BZXCPW5&location=3055))
