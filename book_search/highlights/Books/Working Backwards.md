### Highlights

- Jeff described Amazon this way: “Our culture is four things: customer obsession instead of competitor obsession; willingness to think long term, with a longer investment horizon than most of our peers; eagerness to invent, which of course goes hand in hand with failure; and then, finally, taking professional pride in operational excellence.” ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=48))

- Strong leadership principles represent a company’s vision and enable good and fast decisions throughout the company. Codifying those principles is a huge step forward, as we’ve seen, but there is another step that is equally important: to embed them into every one of your company’s core processes, including hiring, performance management, planning, operating cadence, and career development.

- “The best way to fail at inventing something is by making it somebody’s part-time job.”6 ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1358))
- The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than “writing” a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what, and how things are related. Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas.3 ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=1473))
- Invention is not the solution to every problem. For instance, when Amazon started, the company did not create its own computer hardware. On the flip side, when we were planning our e-book business, we decided to get into the hardware game with Kindle. The reason: invention works well where differentiation matters. In the company’s early days, the hardware that powered Amazon’s data centers was not the point of differentiation with the customer—creating a compelling book-buying online experience was. Whereas with Kindle, as we will describe in chapter seven, others were selling e-books, so there was real value in owning and controlling the creation of an outstanding device for our customers to read them on. Differentiation with customers is often one of the key reasons to invent. ([Location 2642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2642))

- a typical company that wanted to grow would take stock of its existing capabilities and ask, “What can we do next with our skill set?” He emphasized that Amazon’s approach was always to start from the customer and work backwards. We would figure out what the customers’ needs were and then ask ourselves, “Do we have the skills necessary to build something that meets those needs? If not, how can we build or acquire them?” ([Location 2956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=2956))

- You only need to ruthlessly stick to the simple-to-understand (but sometimes hard-to-follow) principles and process that insist on customer obsession, encourage thinking long term, value innovation, and stay connected to the details.

- “Why would I fire you now? I just made a million-dollar investment in you. Now you have an obligation to make that investment pay off. Figure out and clearly document where you went wrong. Share what you have learned with other leaders throughout the company. Be sure you don’t make the same mistake again, and help others avoid making it the first time.” ([Location 3622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=3622))

- there was one important way that the world of digital media was the same as the old, analog media world: there was still a great advantage to be had in control. In the old media world, you could control one of two things: the method of distribution of the content or the content itself (or in some cases both).

- There is a difficult chicken-and-egg problem with a subscription service. You need to have a great offering to attract paying subscribers. To be able to afford a great offering, you need a lot of paying subscribers. It’s a challenging cold-start problem that generally requires a large up-front investment, which you can hopefully pay back with subscriber growth in future years.

- “Cost following” means that your pricing model is driven primarily by your costs, which are then passed on to your customer. This is what construction companies use, because building your customer’s gazebo out of redwood will cost you a lot more than building it out of pine.

- Bias for Action is an important leadership principle at Amazon, and with AWS we were certainly under time pressure to launch this product before our competitors did. But Bias for Action does not obviate the need for the painstaking aspects of the Working Backwards process. ([Location 4268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BYCQBZN&location=4268))
