### Highlights

- Directness is the practice of learning by directly doing the thing you want to learn. Basically, it’s improvement through active practice rather than through passive learning. The phrases learning something new and practicing something new may seem similar, but these two methods can produce profoundly different results. Passive learning creates knowledge. Active practice creates skill. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=60))
- photographer? Your deepest moments of happiness don’t come from doing easy things; they come from realizing your potential and overcoming your own limiting beliefs about yourself. Ultralearning offers a path to master those things that will bring you deep satisfaction and self-confidence. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=458))
- Metalearning: First Draw a Map. Start by learning how to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle. Discover how to do good research and how to draw on your past competencies to learn new skills more easily. Focus: Sharpen Your Knife. Cultivate the ability to concentrate. Carve out chunks of time when you can focus on learning, and make it easy to just do it. Directness: Go Straight Ahead. Learn by doing the thing you want to become good at. Don’t trade it off for other tasks, just because those are more convenient or comfortable. Drill: Attack Your Weakest Point. Be ruthless in improving your weakest points. Break down complex skills into small parts; then master those parts and build them back together again. Retrieval: Test to Learn. Testing isn’t simply a way of assessing knowledge but a way of creating it. Test yourself before you feel confident, and push yourself to actively recall information rather than passively review it. Feedback: Don’t Dodge the Punches. Feedback is harsh and uncomfortable. Know how to use it without letting your ego get in the way. Extract the signal from the noise, so you know what to pay attention to and what to ignore. Retention: Don’t Fill a Leaky Bucket. Understand what you forget and why. Learn to remember things not just for now but forever. Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building Up. Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills. Understand how understanding works, and don’t recourse to cheap tricks of memorization to avoid deeply knowing things. Experimentation: Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone. All of these principles are only starting points. True mastery comes not just from following the path trodden by others but from exploring possibilities they haven’t yet imagined.

- Answering “Why?” ([Location 857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=857))
- The first question to try to answer is why are you learning and what that implies for how you should approach the project. Practically speaking, the projects you take on are going to have one of two broad motivations: instrumental and intrinsic. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=858))
- Answering “What?” ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=902))
- Once you’ve finished your brainstorm, underline the concepts, facts, and procedures that are going to be most challenging. This will give you a good idea what the major learning bottlenecks are going to be and can start you searching for methods and resources to overcome those difficulties. You might recognize that learning medicine requires a lot of memorization, so you may invest in a system such as spaced-repetition software. If you’re learning mathematics, you might recognize that deep understanding of certain concepts is going to be the tricky spot and consider spending time explaining those concepts to other people so you really understand them yourself. Knowing what the bottlenecks will be can help you start to think of ways of making your study time more efficient and effective, as well as avoid tools that probably won’t be too helpful to your goal.

- Answering “How?” ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=937))
- Benchmarking The way to start any learning project is by finding the common ways in which people learn the skill or subject. This can help you design a default strategy as a starting point. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=941))
- The Emphasize/Exclude Method ([Location 954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=954))
- The Emphasize/Exclude Method involves first finding areas of study that align with the goals you identified in the first part of your research. If you’re learning French with the idea of going to Paris for two weeks and speaking in shops and restaurants, I would focus a lot more on pronunciation than being able to spell correctly. If you’re learning programming solely to make your own app, I’d focus on the inner workings of app development more than theories of computation. The second part of the Emphasize/Exclude ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=958))

- Improving Your Ability to Focus ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=1235))
- The impulse to engage in distractions will weaken each time you resist it. With patience and persistence, your few minutes may become large enough to accomplish great things, ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=1242))
- The easiest way to learn directly is to simply spend a lot of time doing the thing you want to become good at. If you want to learn a language, speak it, as Benny Lewis does. If you want to master making video games, then make them, as Eric Barone does. If you want to pass a test, practice solving the kinds of problems that are likely to appear on it, as I did in my own MIT Challenge. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=1322))
- But this very difficulty creates a potent source of competitive advantage for any would-be ultralearner. If you’re willing to apply tactics that exploit directness despite these difficulties, you will end up learning much more effectively.

- Feedback works well when it provides useful information that can guide future learning. ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=1930))
- Ultralearners acquire skills quickly because they seek aggressive feedback when others opt for practice that includes weaker forms of feedback or no feedback at all. ([Location 1958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=1958))
- outcome feedback, informational feedback, and corrective feedback. Outcome feedback is the most common and in many situations the only type of feedback available.

- Receiving feedback isn’t always easy. If you process it as a message about your ego rather than your skills, it’s easy to let a punch become a knockout. ([Location 2109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2109))

- Feedback and the information it provides, however, is useful only if you remember the lessons it teaches. Forgetting is human nature, so it is not enough to learn; you also need to make the information stick. ([Location 2114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2114))

- Memory Mechanism 2—Proceduralization: Automatic Will Endure ([Location 2317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2317))
- There’s evidence that procedural skills, such as riding a bicycle, are stored in a different way from declarative knowledge, such as knowing the Pythagorean Theorem or the Sine Rule for triangles. ([Location 2319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2319))
- One dominant theory of learning suggests that most skills proceed through stages—starting declarative but ending up procedural as you practice more. ([Location 2324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2324))
- Memory Mechanism 3—Overlearning: Practice Beyond Perfect ([Location 2357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2357))

- One way you can introduce this into your own efforts is to give yourself a “struggle timer” as you work on problems. When you feel like giving up and that you can’t possibly figure out the solution to a difficult problem, try setting a timer for another ten minutes to push yourself a bit further.

- The Feynman Technique ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2647))
- The method is quite simple: Write down the concept or problem you want to understand at the top of a piece of paper. In the space below, explain the idea as if you had to teach it to someone else. If it’s a concept, ask yourself how you would convey the idea to someone who has never heard of it before. If it’s a problem, explain how to solve it and—crucially—why that solution procedure makes sense to you. When you get stuck, meaning your understanding fails to provide a clear answer, go back to your book, notes, teacher, or reference material to find the answer. ([Location 2652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2652))
- When people hear about geniuses, especially the iconoclastic ones such as Feynman, there’s a tendency to focus on their gifts and not their efforts. I have no doubt that Feynman possessed gifts. But perhaps his greatest one was his ability to merge tenacious practice and play. He approached picking locks with the same enthusiasm for solving puzzles that he did for unraveling the secrets of quantum electrodynamics. It’s this spirit of playful exploration that I want to turn to in the final principle of ultralearning: experimentation.

- Experimenting with Technique ([Location 2830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2830))
- Pick some subtopic within the skill you’re trying to cultivate, spend some time learning it aggressively, and then evaluate your progress. ([Location 2836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2836))
- Experimenting with Style ([Location 2839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2839))
- The experimental mindset doesn’t just assume that growth is possible but creates an active strategy for exploring all the possible ways to reach it. To get into the right mental space for experimenting, you need not only to see your abilities as something you can improve but understand that there is a huge number of potential avenues to do this. Exploration, not dogmatism, is the key to realizing that potential. ([Location 2868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2868))

- It’s practically an axiom of design that the best innovations come from working within constraints. Give a designer unlimited freedom, and the solution is usually a mess. On the other hand, creating specific constraints in how you can proceed encourages you to explore options that are less familiar to you and sharpens your underlying skills. ([Location 2904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K6MF8MD&location=2904))
- Experimentation is the principle that ties all the others together. Not only does it make you try new things and think hard about how to solve specific learning challenges, it also encourages you to be ruthless in discarding methods that don’t work. Careful experimentation not only brings out your best potential, it also eliminates bad habits and superstitions by putting them to the test of real-world results.
