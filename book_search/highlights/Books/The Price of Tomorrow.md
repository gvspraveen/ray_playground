### Highlights

- Our economic systems were not built for a world driven by technology where prices keep falling. They were built for a pre-technology era when labour and capital were inextricably linked, an era that counted on growth and inflation, an era where we made money from scarcity and inefficiency. That era is over. But we keep on pretending that those economic systems still work. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=156))
- The only thing driving growth in the world today is easy credit, which is being created at a pace that is hard to comprehend. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=171))
- With deflation, holders of currency are the winners, since their dollars can buy more goods and services in the future than they could today. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=241))
- domestic product (GDP) can be considered in isolation. There are four components that make up GDP:6 Consumer spending or personal consumption (C) Investments (I) Net exports (X) Government spending (G) The mathematical formula to calculate the components of GDP (Y) is simple: Y = C + I + X + G. GDP comes down to the interplay of those four components. Countries rely primarily on different levers because the inputs compete against each other. GDP tells you how each country is managing the four inputs together. As a by-product of that, it also tells you what a government values more to drive their economy and jobs. Higher-income countries typically rely on consumer spending as a primary driver of GDP growth, while lower-income countries are more likely to depend on net exports. These inputs compete against each other: for example, in countries with higher incomes, consumer spending naturally increases, but because their jobs pay more, their exports to other countries are disadvantaged by being more expensive.

- This is also happening between China and the US, and not in the way you might think. China has been buying US government debt as a consequence of trade. It now has more than $1.1 trillion of US reserves and tops the global list of US Treasury bond holders. As with Germany lending money to Greece, this can be looked at as vendor financing, such as you might get from a car dealer: I provide you cheap capital so that you purchase my goods, and I make more in the long run. It also helps to ensure a US market for China’s exports by keeping interest rates low, so that consumers spend more. But China cannot reasonably stop buying government bonds without collapsing its own economy, because then interest rates would move much higher in the US and cripple consumer spending, which would then collapse China’s economy. It’s a feedback loop in interconnected economies. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=447))
- the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their desserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become “profiteers,” who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.7 ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=539))
- A market where government reaches in to decide who wins or loses is nothing more than crony capitalism, where wealth is not created by the value you create and the risks you take to get there but by a political system that rewards its insiders. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=587))
- not the debt itself that acts to undermine capitalism. It is the act of stabilizing an economy through socializing the losses when faced with a collapse that undermines capitalism’s own institutional framework.

- As Jeff Bezos said in 2019, “I very frequently get the question: ‘What’s going to change in the next ten years?’ And that is a very interesting question; it’s a very common one. I almost never get the question: ‘What’s not going to change in the next ten years?’ And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two—because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time... In our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that’s going to be true ten years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection.” ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=993))

- These things are true: 1) error correction is at the heart of all of our “intelligence”; 2) information is growing at an exponential pace; 3) that information is being transferred to computers that can gain knowledge and correct errors faster than human brains can; and 4) Every one of our jobs is a function of our intelligence.

- The studies seem to indicate that once division and consolidation of one group against another take hold, it might be very difficult to stop, even when personal moral authority deems otherwise. ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=2173))
- Game theory and its implications apply to many of our most contentious societal debates, all arising from the same core issue: in group dynamics, what might be better for one person often is worse for the group.

- The rise of fiat currencies that could be manipulated domestically and the bailout in 2008 changed that strategy to one where the players whose bad bets caused the crisis, instead of being wiped out, were rewarded handsomely. Capitalism’s long-dominant cooperative strategy was replaced by a non-dominant strategy, crony capitalism, where the cheaters won. Perhaps, ([Location 2305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=2305))
- As we have seen throughout this book, this strategy has only one endgame: 1) higher inequality, 2) people losing hope in the system due to not being able to make ends meet, 3) more polarization, 4) a rise of leaders that use the polarization to create “us versus them” narratives to consolidate power, and 5) commonplace revolution and wars. This solution, in the end, is a dissolution. ([Location 2389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=2389))
- Even for the most ardent capitalist, it could be self-serving. Capitalism collapses in a world where there are no buyers. Job losses and income inequality will reduce the number of people who can participate in the economy. At some point along that continuum of fewer people participating in the economy, the math doesn’t work, and the system collapses anyway. That means that even though universal basic income sounds radical to some, it is at least an alternative to that outcome. On execution, it becomes much more difficult. Universal basic income is essentially a version of wealth transfer. Beyond the traditional arguments from the right that it disincentivizes work and, as a result, incentivizes people to get paid for nothing, there is a cornucopia of additional challenges because of the complexity in determining the right wage. How would government differentiate wages by needs—choosing to live in one city versus another, for example, because of varying costs of living? What if someone chose to live in an expensive city because the opportunities for jobs were higher there but still couldn’t find a job—would the basic income be higher for that person? What about people with disabilities or dependents? ([Location 2401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=2401))
- global debt is already so high and expanding quickly, a reset of debt is needed in any truly viable solution. That reset will likely be painful and could erase vast fortunes overnight while also creating new ones. Similar resets have happened in the past. There will be winners and losers depending on where bets are placed. ([Location 2418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08334WFSQ&location=2418))
- leaders of the world came together in 1944 to establish Bretton Woods—a framework for global cooperation. A key construct of Bretton Woods was an agreed-upon international monetary system where all countries tied exchange rates to the price of gold and the US dollar; the US dollar became the primary currency of the world and the US dollar was tied to gold through a fixed exchange rate. The new rules established trust in an international framework that allowed global trade to expand and increased global prosperity because it meant that countries could not artificially manipulate their currencies at will. Again, as game theory predicts, the agreement showed that when countries work together with a clear understanding of the rules, prosperity was enhanced for all. But in 1971, the United States unilaterally terminated a critical aspect of the system—the conversion of the US dollar to gold—and with that change created a system where the US dollar, a fiat currency subject to domestic agenda, was the backbone of the world’s economic order.

- Since the US dollar became the primary currency of the world without a peg to gold, it gave the US tremendous influence in global affairs. It also enabled a single country to change the rules by printing more currency, and therefore set the stage to return to where we are now, where each country manipulates its currency for political gain while worsening a framework for fair trade.
