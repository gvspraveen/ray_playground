### Highlights

- The solution to the Cold Start Problem starts by understanding how to add a small group of the right people, at the same time, using the product in the right way. Getting this initial network off the ground is the key, and the key is the “atomic network”—the smallest, stable network from which all other networks can be built.

- Disruptive technologies are dismissed as toys because when they are first launched they “undershoot” user needs. The first telephone could only carry voices a mile or two. The leading telco of the time, Western Union, passed on acquiring the phone because they didn’t see how it could possibly be useful to businesses and railroads—their primary customers. What they failed to anticipate was how rapidly telephone technology and infrastructure would improve (technology adoption is usually non-linear due to so-called complementary network effects). The same was true of how mainframe companies viewed the PC (microcomputer), and how modern telecom companies viewed Skype.

- What people are doing on their nights and weekends represents all the underutilized time and energy in the world. If put to good use, this can become the basis of the hard side of an atomic network. ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08HZ5XY7X&location=1240))
- Networked products must balance the needs of multiple sides of a network—not just buyers, but sellers, too. Not just content creators, but viewers as well. And the most important features in networked products often revolve around how users find and connect with each other, whether that’s photo tagging, sharing permissions, or “People You May Know.” This is what lets users connect with relevant people and content on the platform, whether that’s your favorite video game streamer, the right project area for your team, or something else. This is a concept missing from traditional software products, where the richness and complexity of the experience depends on who’s on the network rather than the feature set.
