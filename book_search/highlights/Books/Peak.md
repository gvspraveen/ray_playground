### Highlights

- This is a fundamental truth about any sort of practice: If you never push yourself beyond your comfort zone, you will never improve. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B011H56MKS&location=490))
- In the brain, the greater the challenge, the greater the changes—up to a point. Recent studies have shown that learning a new skill is much more effective at triggering structural changes in the brain than simply continuing to practice a skill that one has already learned. On the other hand, pushing too hard for too long can lead to burnout and ineffective learning. The brain, like the body, changes most quickly in that sweet spot where it is pushed outside—but not too far outside—its comfort zone.
