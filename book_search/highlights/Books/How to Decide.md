### Highlights

- Because there are only two things that determine how your life turns out: luck and the quality of your decisions. You have control over only one of those two things. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=185))

    - **Note:** Quality of decisions negates luck in long run
- The only thing you have control over that can influence the way your life turns out is the quality of your decisions. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=188))

- good decision tool seeks to reduce the role of cognitive bias (such as overconfidence, hindsight bias, or confirmation bias) and a pros and cons list tends to amplify the role of bias. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=227))

- If your decision process becomes better than it is now—improving the accuracy of your knowledge and beliefs, improving how you compare available options, and improving your ability to forecast the futures that might result from those options—that is worth pursuing.

- Resulting makes you think that you know something about whether a decision was good or bad because you know if the outcome is good or bad. Hindsight bias adds to the ruckus caused by knowing the outcome, distorting your memory of what you knew at the time of the decision in two ways: ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=715))

- HINDSIGHT BIAS The tendency to believe an event, after it occurs, was predictable or inevitable. It’s also been referred to as “knew-it-all-along” thinking or “creeping determinism.” ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=721))

- The paradox of experience: Experience is necessary for learning, but individual experiences often interfere with learning. This is partly because of the biases that cause us to overfit outcomes and decision quality. ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1162))
    - **Tags:** #decision
    - **Note:** overfitting
- Our willingness to examine outcomes is asymmetrical. We are more eager to put bad outcomes in context than good ones. Becoming a better decision-maker requires us to try (difficult though it may be) to put those good outcomes in perspective.

- THE DECISION MULTIVERSE CHECKLIST When evaluating whether the outcome provides a lesson about decision quality, create a simplified decision tree, starting with the following: ☐ Identify the decision. ☐ Identify the actual outcome. ☐ Along with the actual outcome, create a tree with other reasonable outcomes that were possible at the time of the decision. ☐ Explore the other possible outcomes to understand better what is to be learned from the actual outcome you got.

- SIX STEPS TO BETTER DECISION-MAKING
  Step 1—Identify the reasonable set of possible outcomes.
  Step 2—Identify your preference using the payoff for each outcome—to what degree do you like or dislike each outcome, given your values?
  Step 3—Estimate the likelihood of each outcome unfolding.
  Step 4—Assess the relative likelihood of outcomes you like and dislike for the option under consideration.
  Step 5—Repeat Steps 1–4 for other options under consideration. Step 6—Compare the options to one another. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1219))

- Assessing the quality of a decision involves figuring out whether going for the upside is worth risking the downside. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1327))

- The bad news is that a pros and cons list doesn’t get you thinking about magnitude, how big a positive any pro is or how big a negative any con is, ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1332))
    - **Tags:** #decision
- To figure out whether a decision is good or bad, you need to know not just the things that might reasonably happen and what could be gained or lost, but also the likelihood of each possibility unfolding. That means, to become a better decision-maker, you need to be willing to estimate those probabilities. ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1352))
    - **Tags:** #decision
- This way of thinking, that there is only “right” and “wrong” and nothing in between, is one of the biggest obstacles to good decision-making. Because good decision-making requires a willingness to guess. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1382))

- Whether you’re estimating the weight of a bison or the likelihood that Kingdom Comb will succeed, your job as a decision-maker is to figure out two things: (1) What do I already know that will make my guess more educated? (2) What can I find out that will make my guess more educated? ([Location 1424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1424))

- THE THREE PS CHECKLIST When evaluating a past decision or making a new decision, refer to the Six Steps to Better Decision-Making:
  ☐ Step 1—Identify the reasonable set of possible outcomes. These outcomes can be general scenarios or be focused on particular aspects of the outcomes that you especially care about.
  ☐ Step 2—Identify your preference for each outcome—to what degree do you like or dislike each outcome, given your values? These preferences will be driven by the payoffs associated with each outcome. Gains comprise the upside and losses comprise the downside. Include this information in your decision trees.
  ☐ Step 3—Estimate the likelihood of each outcome unfolding. As a start, use common terms that express probabilities. Don’t be afraid to guess.
  ☐ Step 4—Assess the relative likelihood of outcomes you like and dislike for the option under consideration.
  ☐ Step 5—Repeat Steps 1–4 for other options under consideration.
  ☐ Step 6—Compare the options to one another. ([Location 1621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1621))

- we’re generally overselling our knowledge rather than underselling it. We’re usually much more certain of our guesses than the accuracy of our beliefs warrant. ([Location 1946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1946))
- In general, we don’t question our own beliefs enough. We have too much confidence in what we think we know and we don’t have a realistic view of what we don’t know. Whether it’s about the things we believe to be true, our opinions, or how we think the future might unfold, we could all use a healthy dose of skepticism. ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=1974))
- We’re pretty bad at figuring out when our beliefs are inaccurate. We have too much confidence in what we think we know. One reason for these weaknesses is that it’s very hard for us to see the world from outside our own perspective. ([Location 2090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=2090))

- Confirmation bias—Our tendency to notice, interpret, and seek out information that confirms or strengthens our existing beliefs. Disconfirmation bias—Confirmation bias’s sibling. Our tendency to apply a higher, more critical standard to information that contradicts our beliefs than to information that confirms them. Overconfidence—Overestimating our skills, intellect, or talent, interfering with our ability to make decisions depending on such estimates. Availability bias—The tendency to overestimate the frequency of events that are easy to recall because they are vivid or because we’ve experienced them a lot. Recency bias—Believing that recent events are more likely to occur than they actually are. Illusion of control—Overestimating our ability to control events. In other words, to underestimate the influence of luck. ([Location 2111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=2111))

- The value of getting other people’s perspectives is not just that they know facts that you don’t know that might be helpful to you. It is not just that they might be able to correct inaccuracies in the facts you think you know. It is that even if they had the exact same facts as you, they might view those facts differently. They might come to a very different conclusion given the exact same information. ([Location 2146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=2146))

- When we approach a decision, we have already started to form an opinion about what the right option is. Usually we don’t even know we have already formed an opinion, but that opinion can, nonetheless, end up in the driver’s seat, directing our decision process. This exposes the biggest issue with a pros and cons list: Like your intuition and gut, it also serves at the pleasure of the inside view, getting you to the decision you want to make rather than the decision that is objectively better. Want to reject an option? You’ll focus on the con side of the list, expanding that side of the comparision. Want to move forward with an option? You’ll focus and expand on the pro side of the list as the cons hide in the shadows. A pros and cons list is generated entirely from your perspective, absent the outside view, easily infected by reasoning in a way that is motivated to support a conclusion you want to get to. In fact, if you wanted to create a decision tool to amplify bias, it would look like a pros and cons list. ([Location 2153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=2153))

- THE HAPPINESS TEST Ask yourself if the outcome of your decision, good or bad, will likely have a significant effect on your happiness in a year. If the answer is no, the decision passes the test, which means you can speed up. Repeat for a month and a week. The shorter the time period for which your answer is “no, it won’t much affect my happiness,” the more you can trade off accuracy in favor of saving time.

- The very thing that slows you down—having multiple options that are very close in quality—is actually a signal that you can go fast, because this tells you that whichever option you choose, you can’t possibly be that wrong, since both options have similar upside and downside potential.

- Instead of taking tons of time trying to tease out the small differences between the choices, reframe the decision by asking yourself, “Whichever option I choose, how wrong can I be?” ([Location 2746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=2746))

- WHEN A DECISION IS HARD, THAT MEANS IT’S EASY When you’re weighing two options that are close, then the decision is actually easy, because whichever one you choose you can’t be that wrong since the difference between the two is so small.

- You can identify low-impact decisions with the Happiness Test, asking yourself if how your decision turns out will likely have an effect on your happiness in a week, a month, or a year. If the type of thing you are deciding about passes the Happiness Test, you can go fast. ([Location 2989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=2989))

- use the Only-Option Test, asking yourself for each option, “If this were the only option I had, would I be happy with it?” If your answer is yes for more than one option, you could flip a coin since you can’t be that wrong whichever option you pick. ([Location 2996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=2996))

- To determine whether you can decide faster, ask yourself the following questions: ☐ Does the type of thing you’re deciding about pass the Happiness Test? If yes, go fast. ☐ Does it pass the Happiness Test with repeating options? If yes, go even faster. ☐ Are you freerolling? If yes, go fast in seizing the opportunity but take time in the execution. ☐ Is your decision a sheep in wolf’s clothing, with multiple options that pass the Only-Option Test? If yes, go fast, even flipping a coin to make your choice. ☐ Can you quit your choice and pick a different option at a reasonable cost? If yes, go fast. If no, can you decision stack? ☐ Can you exercise multiple options in parallel? If yes, go fast. ☐ Is there additional information (available at a reasonable cost) that would establish a clearly preferred option or, if there is already a clearly preferred option, change your preference? If yes, go find it. If no, decide. ([Location 3015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=3015))

- PREMORTEM Imagining yourself at some time in the future, having failed to achieve a goal, and looking back at how you arrived at that destination. ([Location 3199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=3199))
- STEPS FOR A PREMORTEM (1) Identify the goal you’re trying to achieve or a specific decision you’re considering. (2) Figure out a reasonable time period for achieving the goal or for the decision to play out. (3) Imagine it’s the day after that period of time and you didn’t achieve the goal, or the decision worked out poorly. Looking back from that imagined point in the future, list up to five reasons why you failed due to your own decisions and actions or those of your team. (4) List up to five reasons why you failed due to things outside your control. (5) If you’re doing this as a team exercise, have each member do steps (3) and (4) independently, prior to a group discussion of reasons.

- STEPS FOR A BACKCAST (1) Identify the goal you’re trying to achieve or a specific decision you’re considering. (2) Figure out a reasonable time period for achieving the goal or for the decision to play out. (3) Imagine it’s the day after that period of time and you achieved the goal, or the decision worked out well. Looking back from that imagined point in the future, list up to five reasons why you succeeded due to your own decisions and actions or those of your team. (4) List up to five reasons why you succeeded due to things outside of your control. (5) If you’re doing this as a team exercise, have each member do steps (3) and (4) independently, prior to a group discussion of reasons.

- A premortem combines prospective hindsight with mental contrasting. To do a premortem, you place yourself in the future and imagine that you have failed to achieve your goal. You then consider the potential reasons things worked out poorly. ([Location 3597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TRJB3S3&location=3597))
