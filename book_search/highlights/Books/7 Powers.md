- Scale Economies: Benefit: Reduced Cost Barrier: Prohibitive Costs of Share Gains ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=415))
- Buffett’s observation: “When a manager with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, the reputation of the business remains intact.” ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=625))
- Counter-Positioning: A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=706))

- Pundits have looked back and chided Kodak for poor management, lack of vision, and organizational inertia, and a reasonable person might well ask, “How could a company high on the lists of the best companies in the world succumb to such a defeat?” A reasonable question. And the answer is much simpler than many suggest: in fact, Kodak was fully aware of its eventual fate and spent lavishly to explore survival options, but digital photography simply was not an attractive business opportunity for the company. Kodak’s business model was built on its Power in film—it was not a camera company. The digital substitute for film was semiconductor storage, and Kodak brought nothing to this arena.

- Once market erosion becomes severe, a Counter-Positioned incumbent comes under tremendous pressure to do something; at the same time, they face great pressure to not upset the apple cart of the legacy business model. A frequent outcome of this duality? Let’s call it dabbling: the incumbent puts a toe in the water, somehow, but refuses to commit in a way that meaningfully answers the challenge.

- A company that has embedded Switching Costs for its current customers can charge higher prices than competitors for equivalent products or services.40 This benefit only accrues to the Power holder in selling follow-on products to their current customers; they hold no Benefit with potential customers and there is no Benefit if there are no follow-on products. Barrier. To offer an equivalent product,41 competitors must compensate customers for Switching Costs. The firm that has previously roped in the customer, then, can set or adjust prices in a way that puts their potential rival at a cost disadvantage, rendering such a challenge distinctly unattractive. Thus, as with Scale Economies and Network Economies, the Barrier arises from the unattractive cost/benefit of share gains for the challenger.

- Switching Costs offer no Benefit if no additional related sales are made to the customer. To assure that such additional sales take place, one tactic might be to develop more and more add-on products. This has been SAP’s tack, as seen from this Wikipedia list of the company’s offerings.45 ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1016))

- Branding is an asset that communicates information and evokes positive emotions in the customer, leading to an increased willingness to pay for the product. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1101))

- definition of Process Power: Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or superior product, and which can be matched only by an extended commitment. ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1481))
- Scale Economies. With this first Power type, you must simultaneously pursue a business model that promises Scale Economies (industry economics), while at the same time offering up a product differentially attractive enough to pull in customers and gain relative share (competitive position). Network Economies. Here the needs are similar to Scale Economies, except that installed base, rather than sales share, is the goal. Cornered Resource. You must secure the rights to a valuable resource on attractive terms. This often comes from having developed that resource in the first place and then gaining ownership of it, the most common avenue being a patent award for research developments. Branding. Over an extensive period of time, you make the consistent creative choices which foster in the customer’s mind an affinity that goes beyond the product’s objective attributes. Counter-Positioning. You pioneer a new, superior business model that promises collateral damage for incumbents if mimicked. Switching Costs. With Switching Costs, you must first attain a customer base, meaning the same new-product requirements demanded of Scale and Network Economies factor in here as well. Process Power. You evolve a new complex process which renders itself inimitable within a reasonable period and yet offers significant advantages over a longer period of time.

- So if you want to develop Power, your first step is invention: breakthrough products, engaging brands, innovative business models. The first step, yes, but it can’t be the last step. Had Netflix invented the streaming product without introducing originals, they would have been left with an easily imitated commodity business. There would have been no Power and little value in the business. ([Location 1748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1748))

- Compelling value requires that you mobilize your capabilities to offer up a product that fulfills a significant customer need currently unmet by competitive offerings. This need drives customer adoption. ([Location 1777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1777))
