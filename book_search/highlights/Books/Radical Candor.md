### Highlights

- Your ability to build trusting, human connections with the people who report directly to you will determine the quality of everything that follows. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=331))
- “Radical Candor” is what happens when you put “Care Personally” and “Challenge Directly” ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=348))
- A good rule of thumb for any relationship is to leave three unimportant things unsaid each day. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=473))
- Don’t dish it out before you show you can take it ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=803))
- LET’S RETURN TO the “care personally” dimension of Radical Candor. In order to build a great team, you need to understand how each person’s job fits into their life goals. You need to get to know each person who reports directly to you, to have real, human relationships—relationships that change as people change.

- your job is not to provide purpose but instead to get to know each of your direct reports well enough to understand how each one derives meaning from their work. ([Location 1097](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=1097))
- The Peter Principle results in people getting promoted beyond their level of competence—an unhappy situation for everyone, especially the person who’s been promoted. ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=1235))
- IT’S HARD NOT to lock in your perceptions of people. “Jane is a rock star. Once a rock star, always a rock star.” “Sean is my Rock of Gibraltar. I’d be lost without him in his role.” My biggest concern with the terms “rock star” and “superstar” is that you’ll use them as permanent labels for people. Please do not! It’s tempting to see certain people as fit only for a certain role or having a certain set of skills/weaknesses that will never change. The truth is, people really do change. Somebody who’s been on a gradual growth trajectory may suddenly become restless and yearn for a new challenge at work. Or, a person who’s been on a steep growth trajectory for years may be craving a period of stability. This is another reason why you have to manage. Being a great boss involves constantly adjusting to the new reality of the day or week or year as it unfolds. But you can’t adjust if you haven’t been paying attention or if you don’t know the person well enough to notice that something significant has shifted.

- run. Take the time to help your direct reports explain what they mean, so that they can do something about fixing the problem or pursuing the opportunity rather than just complaining about it. ([Location 1784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=1784))
- Keep the conversation focused on ideas not egos ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=1860))
- roles. If a person has been arguing for A, ask them to start arguing for B. If a debate is likely to go on for some time, warn people in advance that you’re going to ask them to switch roles. ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=1870))
- It’s tempting to end debates and make a decision too soon when a debate becomes too painful. You might be creeping up on a topic that’s been a subject of great contention. At times like this, people often look to the boss to end the suffering and make a decision. My instinct is to be a peacemaker, or to get to a decision quickly. But a boss’s job is often to keep the debate going rather than to resolve it with a decision. It’s the debates at work that help individuals grow and help the team work better collectively to come up with the best answer.

- That is why kick-ass bosses often do not decide themselves, but rather create a clear decision-making process that empowers people closest to the facts to make as many decisions as possible. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=1956))

- “When the facts change, I change my mind.” ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=2113))
- Don’t think of it as work-life balance, some kind of zero-sum game where anything you put into your work robs your life and anything you put into your life robs your work. Instead, think of it as work-life integration. If you need to get eight hours of sleep to stay centered, those hours are not something that you do for yourself at the expense of your work or your team. Your work and your life can give each other a “double bounce.” ([Location 2182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=2182))
- This simple technique reminds you to describe three things when giving feedback: 1) the situation you saw, 2) the behavior (i.e., what the person did, either good or bad), and 3) the impact you observed. This helps you avoid making judgments about the person’s intelligence, common sense, innate goodness, or other personal attributes. When you pass blanket judgments, your guidance sounds arrogant.

- The “fundamental attribution error” will harm the effectiveness of your guidance. This phrase was coined by Lee Ross, a social psychologist from Stanford. We’ve touched on this already, but it’s useful to repeat because it is so central to healthy human relationships, whether with spouses, children, friends, or the people who report to you. Making a fundamental attribution error is using perceived personality attributes—“You’re stupid, lazy, greedy, hypocritical, an asshole,” etc.—to explain someone else’s behavior rather than considering one’s own behavior and/or the situational factors that were probably the real cause of the other person’s behavior. It’s a problem because 1) it’s generally inaccurate and 2) it renders an otherwise solvable problem really hard to fix since changing core personality attributes is so very difficult and time-consuming.

- There should never be any surprises in a formal performance review, and if you’ve been diligent about offering regular impromptu guidance, you’ll lower the odds of this happening considerably. ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=3075))
- No agenda. If they consistently come with no topics to discuss, it might mean that they are overwhelmed, that they don’t understand the purpose of the meeting, or that they don’t consider it useful. Be direct but polite: “This is your time, but you don’t seem to come with much to talk about. Can you tell me why?” ([Location 3848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01KTIEFEE&location=3848))
