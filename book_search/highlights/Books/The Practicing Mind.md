### Highlights

- easily forget that when our lives here ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=80))
- When we subtly shift toward both focusing on and finding joy in the process of achieving instead of having the goal, we have gained a new skill. And once mastered, it is magical and incredibly empowering. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=92))
- However, the practicing mind is quiet. It lives in the present and has laser-like, pinpoint focus and accuracy. It obeys our precise directions, and all our energy moves through it. Because of this, we are calm and completely free of anxiety. We are where we should be at that moment, doing what we should be doing and completely aware of what we are experiencing. There is no wasted motion, physically or mentally. Going ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=192))
- If you are not in control of your thoughts, then you are not in control of yourself. Without self-control, you have no real power, regardless of whatever else you accomplish. If you are not aware of the thoughts that you think in each moment, then you are the rider with no reins, with no power over where you are going. You cannot control what you are not aware of. Awareness must come first. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=212))
- A paradox of life: The problem with patience and discipline is that developing each of them requires both of them. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=277))
- We have a very unhealthy habit of making the product — our intended result — the goal, instead of the process of reaching that goal. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=326))

- When you focus on the process, the desired product takes care of itself with fluid ease. When you focus on the product, you immediately begin to fight yourself and experience boredom, restlessness, frustration, and impatience with the process.

- In order to focus on the present, we must give up, at least temporarily, our attachment to our desired goal. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=351))

- when your mind is only on the finished product, not only do you feel frustrated in every second that you have not met that goal, but you experience anxiety in every “mistake” you make while practicing. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=362))
- simple rules:        •  Keep yourself process-oriented.        •  Stay in the present.        •  Make the process the goal and use the overall goal as a rudder to steer your efforts.        •  Be deliberate, have an intention about what you want to accomplish, and remain aware of ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=541))
- The problem with patience and discipline is that developing each of them requires both of them. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=554))
- As we attempt to understand ourselves and our struggles with life’s endeavors, we may find peace in the observation of a flower. Ask yourself: At what point in a flower’s life, from seed to full bloom, does it reach perfection? ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=555))
- When you develop a present-minded approach to every activity you are involved in and, like the flower, realize that at whatever level you are performing, you are perfect at that point in time, you experience a tremendous relief from the fictitious, self-imposed pressures and expectations that only slow your progress. At any point in the day when you notice you are feeling bored, impatient, rushed, or disappointed with your performance level, realize that you have left the present moment in your activity. Look at where your mind and energy are focused. You will find that you have strayed into either the future or the past. You might be subconsciously focused on the result or product you are trying to achieve. Such feelings often arise in activities that produce a tangible product, which could be anything from painting the house to losing weight. I class this as a distraction into the future because the product that you want to reach is pulling you out of the present and into the future. You want to get to “full bloom” and skip the rest of it. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=633))
- The practicing mind puts you in control of even the most difficult situations and allows you to work with less effort and negative emotion at any activity. This produces inner peace, and you accomplish more with less effort. ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=770))
- Habits are learned. Choose them wisely. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=773))
- All the patience you will ever need is already within you. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=887))
- “You need to keep reviewing these ideas so that you can hang on to their clarity and perspective. Otherwise, life steals them away.” ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=898))
- To free yourself from this endless and exhausting cycle, you must step back and notice the real you, the Observer who just quietly watches all this drama as it unfolds. As you practice staying in the present, you will become more aware of the difference between the real you and your ego’s internal dialogue, without trying to do so. It will happen automatically. Staying in the present and in the process is the first part of the perspective change that creates patience. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=939))
- The second step in creating patience is understanding and accepting that there is no such thing as reaching a point of perfection in anything. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=943))
- real joy was found in my ability to learn and to experience my growth, moment by moment. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=999))
- It’s like swimming across a lake toward a large tree on the other side. You focus on keeping your head down and pulling the water past you with each stroke. You fill your lungs with fresh air and then expel it in a relaxed fashion, glancing at the position of the tree on the distant shore every so often to keep your sense of direction. You do this with total detachment, or at least as much as you can muster. You say to yourself, “Oh, I need to steer a little to the left; that’s better.” If, however, you try to keep your head above the water the whole time, watching the tree and measuring how much closer you are to it after each stroke and kick, you’ll waste enormous amounts of energy. You will become frustrated, exhausted, and impatient. You will become emotional and judgmental about your progress and lose your stamina. All this energy you are wasting could be funneled into reaching the far side of the lake, but instead you are dissipating it through incorrect effort, which produces negative emotions. You are fighting yourself and pushing against the task. It will take you longer to reach the tree, if you reach it at all.

- The real thrill of acquiring anything, whether it is an object or a personal goal, is your anticipation of the moment of receiving it. The real joy lies in creating and sustaining the stamina and patience needed to work for something over a period of time. ([Location 1060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=1060))

- When you make a decision to acquire something whose acquisition will require a long-term commitment, pick the goal and then be aware that you are entering the process of achieving the goal. You cannot do this if you constantly make the end result your point of focus. You have acknowledged the goal; now let go of it and put your energy into the practice and process that will move you toward that goal. ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=1072))
- Simplicity in effort will conquer the most complex of tasks. ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=1094))
- Nonjudgment is the pathway to a quiet mind! ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=1201))
- calmness. It would certainly seem to be ([Location 1204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=1204))
- When you find yourself falling back into fretting, start the cycle again. Just do, observe, and correct. That’s all there is. There is nothing else, no negative emotions or judgments. It’s tiring at first. Remember, you are breaking an unwanted habit in how you deal with problems. The old habit put most of your energy into fretting and very little of it into solving the problem. In a short time, the new habit of DOC will be a natural part of how you operate. You are shooting arrows at a target: “Oops, missed that one by aiming too far to the left, that’s all. Shoot more to the right.” It’s a game of sorts, and ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=1334))
- Wisdom is not a by-product of age. Teach and learn from all those around you. ([Location 1403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=1403))
- With deliberate and repeated effort, progress is inevitable. ([Location 1492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007C8NRSA&location=1492))
- Even when we feel we have fallen out of our focus on the process, the fact that we are aware of the fall means that we have come back into the present moment. It means that in this awareness, we have come a long way toward integrating present-minded concepts into the way we live. With this knowledge, we live each moment to its fullest, and we experience life directly instead of indirectly.
