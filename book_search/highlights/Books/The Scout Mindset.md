### Highlights

- it scout mindset: the motivation to see things as they are, not as you wish they were. Scout mindset is what allows you to recognize when you are wrong, to seek out your blind spots, to test your assumptions and change course.

- The best description of motivated reasoning I’ve ever seen comes from psychologist Tom Gilovich. When we want something to be true, he said, we ask ourselves, “Can I believe this?,” searching for an excuse to accept it. When we don’t want something to be true, we instead ask ourselves, “Must I believe this?,” searching for an excuse to reject it.4 ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HQ26K&location=181))

- I try to abide by the rule that when you advocate changing something, you should make sure you understand why it is the way it is in the first place. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HQ26K&location=339))
- viewing yourself as rational can backfire. The more objective you think you are, the more you trust your own intuitions and opinions as accurate representations of reality, and the less inclined you are to question them.

- A high IQ and an advanced degree might give you an advantage in ideologically neutral domains like solving math problems or figuring out where to invest your money. But they won’t protect you from bias on ideologically charged questions. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HQ26K&location=790))
- And even though the rhetoric around “following your dream” makes it sound like everyone has one and only one dream, most people have more than one thing they enjoy and are good at, or could at least become good at. You’re doing yourself a disservice if you throw yourself into the pursuit of a goal without asking: “Is this goal worth pursuing, compared to other things I could do instead?” ([Location 1668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HQ26K&location=1668))
- “You want to get into a mental state where if the bad outcome comes to pass, you will only nod your head and say ‘I knew this card was in the deck, and I knew the odds, and I would make the same bets again, given the same opportunities.’” ([Location 1833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HQ26K&location=1833))
- you don’t need to hold your opinions with 100 percent certainty in order to seem confident and competent. People simply aren’t paying that much attention to how much epistemic confidence you express. They’re paying attention to how you act, to your body language, tone, and other aspects of your social confidence, all of which are things you can cultivate without sacrificing your calibration.

- expressing uncertainty isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It depends on whether the uncertainty is “in you” or “in the world.” If you can demonstrate a strong command of the topic and speak with ease about your analysis and your plan, you’ll seem like more of an expert, not less. ([Location 2031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HQ26K&location=2031))
- There are lots of ways to change the game board you’re playing on so that you end up with better choices, instead of simply resigning yourself to picking the least-bad choice currently in front of you. ([Location 2044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HQ26K&location=2044))
- two ways in which scouts think about error differently from most people. First, they revise their opinions incrementally over time, which makes it easier to be open to evidence against their beliefs. Second, they view errors as opportunities to hone their skill at getting things right, which makes the experience of realizing “I was wrong” feel valuable, rather than just painful.

- Discovering you were wrong is an update, not a failure, and your worldview is a living document meant to be revised. ([Location 2236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HQ26K&location=2236))

- Scouts view anomalies as puzzle pieces to collect as you go through the world. You probably won’t know what to do with them at first. But if you hang on to them, you may find that they add up to a richer picture of the world than you had before.

- We all start out with wildly incorrect maps, and over time, as we get more information, we make them somewhat more accurate. Revising your map is a sign you’re doing things right. ([Location 2694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HQ26K&location=2694))
- I recommend picking a small number of scout habits to start with, no more than two or three. Here’s a list of ideas to choose from: The next time you’re making a decision, ask yourself what kind of bias could be affecting your judgment in that situation, and then do the relevant thought experiment (e.g., outsider test, conformity test, status quo bias test). When you notice yourself making a claim with certainty (“There’s no way . . .”), ask yourself how sure you really are. The next time a worry pops into your head and you’re tempted to rationalize it away, instead make a concrete plan for how you would deal with it if it came true. Find an author, media outlet, or other opinion source who holds different views from you, but who has a better-than-average shot at changing your mind—someone you find reasonable or with whom you share some common ground. The next time you notice someone else being “irrational,” “crazy,” or “rude,” get curious about why their behavior might make sense to them. Look for opportunities to update at least a little bit. Can you find a caveat or exception to one of your beliefs, or a bit of empirical evidence that should make you slightly less confident in your position? Think back to a disagreement you had with someone in the past on which your perspective has since shifted and reach out to that person to let them know how you’ve updated. Pick a belief you hold strongly and attempt an ideological Turing test of the other side. (Bonus points if you can actually find someone from the other side to judge your attempt.)

- Keep an eye out for examples of motivated reasoning in yourself—and when you spot one, be proud of yourself for noticing. Remember, motivated reasoning is universal; if you never notice it, that’s probably not because you’re immune. Becoming more aware of motivated reasoning is an essential step on the way to reducing it, and you should feel good about taking that step.
