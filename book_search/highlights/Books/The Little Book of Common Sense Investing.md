### Highlights

- the reason that annual stock returns are so volatile is largely because of the emotions of investing. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008W02TIG&location=353))
- The message is clear: in the long run, stock returns depend almost entirely on the reality of the investment returns earned by our corporations. The perception of investors, reflected by the speculative returns, counts for little. It is economics that controls long-term equity returns; emotions, so dominant in the short-term, dissolve.

- The way to investment success is to get out of the expectations market of stock prices and cast your lot with the real market of business. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008W02TIG&location=432))
- It includes some 4,971 stocks, including the 500 stocks in the S&P 500. However, because its component stocks also are weighted by their market capitalization, those remaining 4,471 stocks account for only about 20 percent of its value. Nonetheless, this broadest of all U.S. stock indexes is the best measure of the aggregate value of stocks, and therefore a superb measure of the returns earned in U.S. stocks by all investors as a group.

- over the long term, the miracle of compounding returns is overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008W02TIG&location=652))
- “The greatest enemy of a good plan is the dream of a perfect plan.” Stick to the good plan. ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008W02TIG&location=1855))
