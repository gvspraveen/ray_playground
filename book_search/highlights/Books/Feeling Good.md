### Highlights

- The first principle of cognitive therapy is that all your moods are created by your “cognitions,” or thoughts. A cognition refers to the way you look at things—your perceptions, mental attitudes, and beliefs. It includes the way you interpret things—what you say about something or someone to yourself. You feel the way you do right now because of the thoughts you are thinking at this moment. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=357))
- Every time you feel depressed about something, try to identify a corresponding negative thought you had just prior to and during the depression. Because these thoughts have actually created your bad mood, by learning to restructure them, you can change your mood.

    - **Note:** Greater lesson: Always try to tackle the root. Not just the symptom
- You must understand what is happening to you before you can feel it. Figure 3–1. The relationship between the world and the way you feel. It is not the actual events but your perceptions that result in changes in mood. When you are sad, your thoughts will represent a realistic interpretation of negative events. When you are depressed or anxious, your thoughts will always be illogical, distorted, unrealistic, or just plain wrong.

- All-or-nothing thinking forms the basis for perfectionism. It causes you to fear any mistake or imperfection because you will then see yourself as a complete loser, and you will feel inadequate and worthless. ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=656))
- Svengali. You arbitrarily conclude that one thing that happened to you once will occur over and over again, ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=669))
- When you are depressed, you wear a pair of eyeglasses with special lenses that filter out anything positive. All that you allow to enter your conscious mind is negative. Because you are not aware of this “filtering process,” you conclude that everything is negative. The technical name for this process is “selective abstraction.” It is a bad habit that can cause you to suffer much needless anguish. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=686))
- Disqualifying the Positive. An even more spectacular mental illusion is the persistent tendency of some depressed individuals to transform neutral or even positive experiences into negative ones. You don’t just ignore positive experiences, you cleverly and swiftly turn them into their nightmarish opposite. I call this “reverse alchemy.” The medieval alchemists dreamed of finding some method for transmuting the baser metals into gold. If you have been depressed, you may have developed the talent for doing the exact opposite—you can instantly transform golden joy into emotional lead. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=690))
- Magnification commonly occurs when you look at your own errors, fears, or imperfections and exaggerate their importance: ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=741))
- When you think about your strengths, you may do the opposite—look through the wrong end of the binoculars so that things look small and unimportant. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=745))
- Should statements generate a lot of unnecessary emotional turmoil in your daily life. When the reality of your own behavior falls short of your standards, your shoulds and shouldn’ts create self-loathing, shame, and guilt. When the all-too-human performance of other people falls short of your expectations, as will inevitably happen from time to time, you’ll feel bitter and self-righteous. You’ll either have to change your expectations to approximate reality or always feel let down by human behavior.

- Table 3–1. Definitions of Cognitive Distortions ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=807))
- The most usual mental distortion to look out for when you are feeling worthless is all-or-nothing thinking. If you see life only in such extreme categories, you will believe your performance will be either great or terrible—nothing else will exist. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=1042))
- Little Steps for Little Feet. A simple and obvious self-activation method involves learning to break any proposed task down into its tiny component parts. This will combat your tendency to overwhelm yourself by dwelling on all the things you have to do. ([Location 1789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=1789))
- Motivation Without Coercion. A possible source of your procrastination is an inappropriate system for self-motivation. You may inadvertently undermine what you attempt by flagellating yourself with so many “oughts,” “shoulds,” and “musts” that you end up drained of any desire to get moving. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=1820))
- Individuals who procrastinate frequently confuse motivation and action. You foolishly wait until you feel in the mood to do something. Since you don’t feel like doing it, you automatically put it off. Your error is your belief that motivation comes first, and then leads to activation and success. But it is usually the other way around; action must come first, and the motivation comes later on. ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=1967))

- it. Your feelings result from the meaning you give to the event, not from the event itself. ([Location 2367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2367))

- Figure 7–1. It is not negative events but your perceptions and thoughts about these events that create your emotional response. ([Location 2369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2369))
- 2.   Is my anger useful? Does it help me achieve a desired goal or does it simply defeat me? ([Location 2512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2512))
- Ten Things You Should Know About Your Anger     1.   The events of this world don’t make you angry. Your “hot thoughts” create your anger. Even when a genuinely negative event occurs, it is the meaning you attach to it that determines your emotional response.               The idea that you are responsible for your anger is ultimately to your advantage because it gives you the opportunity to achieve control and make a free choice about how you want to feel. If it weren’t for this, you would be helpless to control your emotions; they would be irreversibly bound up with every external event of this world, most of which are ultimately out of your control.     2.   Most of the time your anger will not help you. It will immobilize you, and you will become frozen in your hostility to no productive purpose. You will feel better if you place your emphasis on the active search for creative solutions. What can you do to correct the difficulty or at least reduce the chance that you’ll get burned in the same way in the future? This attitude will eliminate to a certain extent the helplessness and frustration that eat you up when you feel you can’t deal with a situation effectively.               If no solution is possible because the provocation is totally beyond your control, you will only make yourself miserable with your resentment, so why not get rid of it? It’s difficult if not impossible to feel anger and joy simultaneously. If you think your angry feelings are especially precious and important, then think about one of the happiest moments of your life. Now ask yourself. How many minutes of that period of peace or jubilation would I be willing to trade in for feeling frustration and irritation instead?     3.   The thoughts that generate anger more often than not will contain distortions. Correcting these distortions will reduce your anger.     4.   Ultimately your anger is caused by your belief that someone is acting unfairly or some event is unjust. The intensity of the anger will increase in proportion to the severity of the maliciousness perceived and if the act is seen as intentional.     5.   If you learn to see the world through other people’s eyes, you will often be surprised to realize their actions are not unfair from their point of view. The unfairness in these cases turns out to be an illusion that exists only in your mind! If you are willing to let go of the unrealistic notion that your concepts of truth, justice, and fairness are shared by everyone, much of your resentment and frustration will vanish.     6.   Other people usually do not feel they deserve your punishment. Therefore, your retaliation is unlikely to help you achieve any positive goals in your interactions with them. Your rage will often just cause further deterioration and polarization, and will function as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even if you temporarily get what you want, any short-term gains from such hostile manipulation will often be more than counterbalanced by a… ([Location 2957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=2957))
- silent assumption that leads to anxiety and depression is “My worth as a human being is proportional to what I have achieved in my life.” ([Location 4728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=4728))
- night. As you become more and more of a workaholic, you will feel excessively driven to produce because if you fail to keep up the pace, you will experience a severe withdrawal characterized by inner emptiness and despair. In the absence of achievement, you’ll feel worthless and bored because you’ll have no other basis for self-respect and fulfillment. ([Location 4752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=4752))
- Another method for overcoming perfectionism involves developing a process orientation. This means you focus on processes rather than outcomes as a basis for evaluating things. ([Location 5302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=5302))
- If you are a perfectionist, you are probably a real procrastinator because you insist on doing things so thoroughly. The secret to happiness is to set modest goals to accomplish them. If you want misery, then by all means cling to your perfectionism and procrastination. ([Location 5356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009UW5X4C&location=5356))

- The essence of this method was: (1) Don’t turn Hank off by defending yourself. Instead, do the opposite—urge him to say all the worst things he can say about you. (2) Try to find a grain of truth in all his criticisms and then agree with him. (3) After this, point out any areas of disagreement in a straightforward, tactful, nonargumentative manner. (4) Emphasize the importance of sticking together, in spite of these occasional disagreements. I could remind Hank that frustration and fighting might slow down our therapy at times, but this need not destroy the relationship or prevent our work from ultimately becoming fruitful.

- Several long-term studies indicate that patients who receive cognitive therapy, alone or in combination with antidepressant medications, appear to stay undepressed longer than patients who receive only antidepressant medication therapy and no psychotherapy.5 This is probably because cognitively treated patients have learned many coping tools to help them to deal with any mood problems they might experience in the future.
