### Highlights

- When you want to influence those you don't control, you will have to get to know them, figure out what they want, build reasonable trust so they will consider making exchanges, satisfy them, and slowly build cooperation. If you already have close relationships, mutual influence is a free-flowing byproduct that seems to happen naturally.

- If people perceive you as interested only in your own advancement or success, they will be wary, resistant, or go underground to retaliate later. In this way, influence in organizations over time goes to the sincere, those genuinely interested in the welfare of others, those who make lots of connections and often engage in mutually profitable exchanges.

- Our basic premise is that your ability to influence—the power that is due to your skills, as much, if not more than your position—comes from access to resources that others want. This works because you gain influence through mutually beneficial exchanges, and the more resources you can supply, the more influence you can get.

- responding only to your own needs isolates you. But if you are too collaborative and selfless, you may get walked on and fail to meet your obligations. The art is to be “more collaborative and helpful than everyone else,” a subtle way of competing without being competitive. But you can't do this as a trick, or you will seem phony and underhanded, undermining your effectiveness. The second guideline is to be as inventive as possible to create win-win outcomes, where you achieve your goals while helping others achieve theirs.
