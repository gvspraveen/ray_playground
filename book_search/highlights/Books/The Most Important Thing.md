### Highlights

- “Experience is what you got when you didn’t get what you wanted.” Good times teach only bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its secrets, and that you needn’t worry about risk. The most valuable lessons are learned in tough times. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=74))

- One of the most important things to bear in mind today is that economics isn’t an exact science. It may not even be much of a science at all, in the sense that in science, controlled experiments can be conducted, past results can be replicated with confidence, and cause-and-effect relationships can be depended on to hold. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=117))
- “There’s a big difference between probability and outcome. Probable things fail to happen—and improbable things happen—all the time.” That’s one of the most important things you can know about investment risk. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=828))
- This paradox exists because most investors think quality, as opposed to price, is the determinant of whether something’s risky. But high quality assets can be risky, and low quality assets can be safe. It’s just a matter of the price paid for them.... Elevated popular opinion, then, isn’t just the source of low return potential, but also of high risk. ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=1071))
- Controlling the risk in your portfolio is a very important and worthwhile pursuit. The fruits, however, come only in the form of losses that don’t happen. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=1137))
- Risk control is the best route to loss avoidance. Risk avoidance, on the other hand, is likely to lead to return avoidance as well. ([Location 1206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=1206))

- Rule number one: most things will prove to be cyclical. • Rule number two: some of the greatest opportunities for gain and loss come when other people forget rule number one. ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=1233))
- “investment is the discipline of relative selection.” ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=1851))
- Patient opportunism, buttressed by a contrarian attitude and a strong balance sheet, can yield amazing profits during meltdowns. ([Location 2117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=2117))
- It’s more important to ensure survival under negative outcomes than it is to guarantee maximum returns under favorable ones. ([Location 2551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=2551))

- “Because ensuring the ability to survive under adverse circumstances is incompatible with maximizing returns in the good times, investors must choose between the two.” ([Location 2666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=2666))
- Many of the psychological or emotional sources of error were discussed in previous chapters: greed and fear; willingness to suspend disbelief and skepticism; ego and envy; the drive to pursue high returns through risk bearing; and the tendency to overrate one’s foreknowledge. ([Location 2791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=2791))
- Leverage magnifies outcomes but doesn’t add value. ([Location 2927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=2927))
- Most of these eleven lessons can be reduced to just one: be alert to what’s going on around you with regard to the supply/demand balance for investable funds and the eagerness to spend them. ([Location 2934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=2934))
- It’s not just your return that matters, but also what risk you took to get it. ([Location 3127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004U5Q1O0&location=3127))
