### Highlights

- At some point, human intelligence became collective and cumulative in a way that happened to no other animal. ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003QP4BJM&location=98))
- Trade is often unequal, but still benefits both sides. This is a point that nearly everybody seems to miss. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003QP4BJM&location=811))
- A successful transaction between two people – a sale and purchase – should benefit both. If it benefits one and not the other, it is exploitation, and it does nothing to raise the standard of living. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003QP4BJM&location=1392))
- The lesson of the last two centuries is that liberty and welfare march hand in hand with prosperity and trade. Countries that lose their liberty to tyrants today, through military coups, are generally experiencing falling per capita income at an average rate of 1.4 per cent at the time – just as it was falling per capita income that helped turn Russia, Germany and Japan into dictatorships between the two world wars.

- the competition which keeps a businessman awake at night is not that from his rivals cutting prices, but that of entrepreneurs making his product obsolete. ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003QP4BJM&location=1574))
