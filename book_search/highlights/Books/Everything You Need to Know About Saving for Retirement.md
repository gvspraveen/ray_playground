- The case for indexing isn’t based on the efficient market hypothesis. It’s based on the simple arithmetic of the cost matters hypothesis. In many areas of the market, there will be a loser for every winner so, on average, investors will get the return of that market less fees.

- Live below your means, not within your means. The only way to get ahead financially is to consistently stay behind your own earnings power. Living within or above your means is how you end up going from paycheck to paycheck without every truly building wealth. The only way to get ahead is by living below your means and setting aside a portion of your income for the future. Delayed gratification is poor branding so just think about this in terms of the time you can buy yourself in the future to do what you want, when you want to do it.

Time is the most important asset in the world because you can’t manufacture more of it. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08P4XF2HP&location=1210))

- Complexity can lead to unanticipated consequences. Simplicity was once described to me as the art of thoughtful reduction. Sherlock Holmes once said, “If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” Complexity, on the other hand, opens you up to far more possibilities and surprises, and not always in a good way.
