### Highlights

- When you are having trouble getting your thinking straight, go to a simple case ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=417))
- When trying to understand a complex real-world situation, think of an everyday analogue ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=567))
- However, just because we do not know what type of high severity event will happen, does not mean that we should not prepare our personal lives, businesses, and investment portfolios to withstand these types of dramatic events. Human psychology leads most of us to extrapolate the near past too far into the future. It lulls us into assurance after periods of calm.

- “The core predicament of medicine — the thing that makes being a patient so wrenching, being a doctor so difficult, and being a part of a society that pays the bills they run up so vexing — is uncertainty. With all that we know nowadays about people and diseases and how to diagnose and treat them, it can be hard to see this, hard to grasp how deeply the uncertainty runs. As a doctor, you come to find, however, that the struggle for caring for people is more often with what you do not know than what you do. Medicine’s ground state is uncertainty. And wisdom — for both patients and doctors — is defined by how one copes with it.”[25] ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=818))
- Ultimately, thinking probabilistically starts by correctly viewing the world as a highly uncertain place. With that view in mind, the logical prescription is to assign probabilities to the various events that could occur, and then update those probabilities as new information arrives. These updated probabilities are used to make better decisions. ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=1172))
- Information is only valuable if it can change your decision ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B098GLJS51&location=1550))
