### Highlights

- Over time, those world-class poker players taught me to understand what a bet really is: a decision about an uncertain future. The implications of treating decisions as bets made it possible for me to find learning opportunities in uncertain environments. Treating decisions as bets, I discovered, helped me avoid common decision traps, learn from results in a more rational way, and keep emotions out of the process as much as possible. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=113))
- Thinking in bets starts with recognizing that there are exactly two things that determine how our lives turn out: the quality of our decisions and luck. Learning to recognize the difference between the two is what thinking in bets is all about. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=132))
- When we work backward from results to figure out why those things happened, we are susceptible to a variety of cognitive traps, like assuming causation when there is only a correlation, or cherry-picking data to confirm the narrative we prefer. We will pound a lot of square pegs into round holes to maintain the illusion of a tight relationship between our outcomes and our decisions.

- “Our thinking can be divided into two streams, one that is fast, automatic, and largely unconscious, and another that is slow, deliberate, and judicious.” The first system, “the reflexive system, seems to do its thing rapidly and automatically, with or without our conscious awareness.” The second system, “the deliberative system . . . deliberates, it considers, it chews over the facts.” ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=240))
- Our goal is to get our reflexive minds to execute on our deliberative minds’ best intentions. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=278))

- The quality of our lives is the sum of decision quality plus luck. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=368))
- What makes a decision great is not that it has a great outcome. A great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge. That state of knowledge, in turn, is some variation of “I’m not sure.” ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=434))

- In most of our decisions, we are not betting against another person. Rather, we are betting against all the future versions of ourselves that we are not choosing. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=684))
- This is ultimately very good news: part of the skill in life comes from learning to be a better belief calibrator, using experience and information to more objectively update our beliefs to more accurately represent the world. The more accurate our beliefs, the better the foundation of the bets we make. There is also skill in identifying when our thinking patterns might lead us astray, no matter what our beliefs are, and in developing strategies to work with (and sometimes around) those thinking patterns. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=724))
- “Findings from a multitude of research literatures converge on a single point: People are credulous creatures who find it very easy to believe and very difficult to doubt. In fact, believing is so easy, and perhaps so inevitable, that it may be more like involuntary comprehension than it is like rational assessment.” ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=753))
- Truthseeking, the desire to know the truth regardless of whether the truth aligns with the beliefs we currently hold, is not naturally supported by the way we process information. We might think of ourselves as open-minded and capable of updating our beliefs based on new information, but the research conclusively shows otherwise. Instead of altering our beliefs to fit new information, we do the opposite, altering our interpretation of that information to fit our beliefs.

- Flaws in forming and updating beliefs have the potential to snowball. Once a belief is lodged, it becomes difficult to dislodge. It takes on a life of its own, leading us to notice and seek out evidence confirming our belief, rarely challenge the validity of confirming evidence, and ignore or work hard to actively discredit information contradicting the belief. This irrational, circular information-processing pattern is called motivated reasoning. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=865))
- There is no sin in finding out there is evidence that contradicts what we believe. The only sin is in not using that evidence as objectively as possible to refine that belief going forward. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1025))

- “Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him.” ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1108))

- Where we blame our own bad outcomes on bad luck, when it comes to our peers, bad outcomes are clearly their fault. While our own good outcomes are due to our awesome decision-making, when it comes to other people, good outcomes are because they got lucky.

- Ideally, our happiness would depend on how things turn out for us regardless of how things turn out for anyone else. Yet, on a fundamental level, fielding someone’s bad outcome as their fault feels good to us. On a fundamental level, fielding someone’s good outcome as luck helps our narrative along. ([Location 1411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1411))
- Engaging the world through the lens of competition is deeply embedded in our animal brains. It’s not enough to boost our self-image solely by our own successes. If someone we view as a peer is winning, we feel like we’re losing by comparison. We benchmark ourselves to them. If their kids are doing better in school than ours, what are we doing wrong with our kids? If their company is in the news because it is about to go public, what’s wrong with us that we’re just inching forward in our work? ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1423))
- Our brain is built to seek positive self-image updates. It is also built to view ourselves in competition with our peers. We can’t install new hardware. Working with the way our brains are built in reshaping habit has a higher chance of success than working against ([Location 1473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1473))
- We can work to get the reward of feeling good about ourselves from being a good credit-giver, a good mistake-admitter, a good finder-of-mistakes-in-good-outcomes, a good learner, and (as a result) a good decision-maker. ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1481))

- Keep the reward of feeling like we are doing well compared to our peers, but change the features by which we compare ourselves: be a better credit-giver than your peers, more willing than others to admit mistakes, more willing to explore possible reasons for an outcome with an open mind, even, and especially, if that might cast you in a bad light or shine a good light on someone else. In this way we can feel that we are doing well by comparison because we are doing something unusual and hard that most people don’t do. That makes us feel exceptional.

- The cumulative effect of being a little better at decision-making, like compounding interest, can have huge effects in the long run on everything that we do. ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=1597))
- The free-press and free-speech guarantees of the Constitution recognize the importance of self-expression, but they also exist because we need mechanisms to assure that information makes it to the public. The government serves the people, so the people own the data and have a right to have the data shared with them. ([Location 2086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2086))
- When we have a negative opinion about the person delivering the message, we close our minds to what they are saying and miss a lot of learning opportunities because of it. Likewise, when we have a positive opinion of the messenger, we tend to accept the message without much vetting. Both are bad. ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2144))
- And we need to be particularly skeptical of information that agrees with us because we know that we are biased to just accept and applaud confirming evidence. ([Location 2265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2265))

- If there is one thing we have learned thus far it is that we like having our ideas affirmed. If we want to engage someone with whom we have some disagreement (inside or outside our group), they will be more open and less defensive if we start with those areas of agreement, which there surely will be. ([Location 2302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2302))

- In addition, when the new information is presented as supplementing rather than negating what has come before, our listeners will be much more open to what we have to say. The simplest rhetorical touches can make a difference. If someone expresses a belief or prediction that doesn’t sound well calibrated and we have relevant information, try to say and, as in, “I agree with you that [insert specific concepts and ideas we agree with], AND . . .” After “and,” add the additional information. In the same exchange, if we said, “I agree with you that [insert specific concepts and ideas you agree with], BUT . . . ,” that challenge puts people on the defensive. “And” is an offer to contribute. “But” is a denial and repudiation of what came before. ([Location 2308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2308))
- Just as we can recruit other people to be our decision buddies, we can recruit other versions of ourselves to act as our own decision buddies. We can harness the power of mental time traveling, operationalizing it, encouraging it, and figuring out ways to cause that collision of past, present, and future as much as possible. Present-us needs that help, and past-us and future-us can be the best decision buddies for the job.* ([Location 2374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2374))

- “Wrong” is a conclusion, not a rationale. And it’s not a particularly accurate conclusion since, as we know, nearly nothing is 100% or 0%. Any words or thoughts denying the existence of uncertainty should be a signal that we are heading toward a poorly calibrated decision. ([Location 2714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2714))

- if we’re going to be self-critical, the focus should be on the lesson and how to calibrate future decisions. ([Location 2716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2716))
- For us to make better decisions, we need to perform reconnaissance on the future. If a decision is a bet on a particular future based on our beliefs, then before we place a bet we should consider in detail what those possible futures might look like. ([Location 2751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2751))
- This is true of most strategic thinking. Whether it involves sales strategies, business strategies, or courtroom strategies, the best strategists are considering a fuller range of possible scenarios, anticipating and considering the strategic responses to each, and so on deep into the decision tree.

- Being able to respond to the changing future is a good thing; being surprised by the changing future is not. Scenario planning makes us nimbler because we’ve considered and are prepared for a wider variety of possible futures.

- Just as great poker players and chess players (and experts in any field) excel by planning further into the future than others, our decision-making improves when we can more vividly imagine the future, free of the distortions of the present. By working backward from the goal, we plan our decision tree in more depth, because we start at the end. ([Location 2882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2882))

- think about time as a tree. The tree has a trunk, branches at the top, and the place where the trunk meets the branches. The trunk is the past. A tree has only one, growing trunk, just as we have only one, accumulating past. The branches are the potential futures. Thicker branches are the equivalent of more probable futures, thinner branches are less probable ones. The place where the top of the trunk meets the branches is the present. There are many futures, many branches of the tree, but only one past, one trunk. ([Location 2987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074DG9LQF&location=2987))
- Life, like poker, is one long game, and there are going to be a lot of losses, even after making the best possible bets. We are going to do better, and be happier, if we start by recognizing that we’ll never be sure of the future. That changes our task from trying to be right every time, an impossible job, to navigating our way through the uncertainty by calibrating our beliefs to move toward, little by little, a more accurate and objective representation of the world. With strategic foresight and perspective, that’s manageable work. If we keep learning and calibrating, we might even get good at it.
