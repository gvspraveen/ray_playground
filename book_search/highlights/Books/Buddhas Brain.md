### Highlights

- when neurons fire together, they wire together—mental activity actually creates new neural structures ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=217))
- What flows through your mind sculpts your brain. Thus, you can use your mind to change your brain for the better—which will benefit your whole being, and every other person whose life you touch. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=222))
- Your brain is three pounds of tofu-like tissue containing 1.1 trillion cells, including 100 billion neurons. On average, each neuron receives about five thousand connections, called synapses, from other neurons (Linden 2007). ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=228))
- Only we humans worry about the future, regret the past, and blame ourselves for the present. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=315))
- We get frustrated when we can’t have what we want, and disappointed when what we like ends. We suffer that we suffer. We get upset about being in pain, angry about dying, sad about waking up sad yet another day. This kind of suffering—which encompasses most of our unhappiness and dissatisfaction—is constructed by the brain. It is made up. Which is ironic, poignant—and supremely hopeful. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=315))
- Virtue simply involves regulating your actions, words, and thoughts to create benefits rather than harms for yourself and others. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=327))
- Mindfulness involves the skillful use of attention to both your inner and outer worlds. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=333))
- Wisdom is applied common sense, which you acquire in two steps. First, you come to understand what hurts and what helps—in other words, the causes of suffering and the path to its end (the focus of chapters 2 and 3). Then, based on this understanding, you let go of those things that hurt and strengthen those that help (chapters 6 and ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=336))
- Virtue, mindfulness, and wisdom are supported by the three fundamental functions of the brain: regulation, learning, and selection. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=342))
- It’s a general moral principle that the more power you have over someone, the greater your duty is to use that power benevolently. Well, who is the one person in the world you have the greatest power over? It’s your future self. You hold that life in your hands, and what it will be depends on how you care for it. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=371))
- chapter 1: Key Points What happens in your mind changes your brain, both temporarily and in lasting ways; neurons that fire together wire together. And what happens in your brain changes your mind, since the brain and mind are a single, integrated system. Therefore, you can use your mind to change your brain to benefit your mind—and everyone else whose life you touch. People who have practiced deeply in the contemplative traditions are the “Olympic athletes” of the mind. Learning how they’ve trained their minds (and thus their brains) reveals powerful ways to have more happiness, love, and wisdom. The brain evolved to help you survive, but its three primary survival strategies also make you suffer. Virtue, mindfulness, and wisdom are the pillars of everyday well-being, personal growth, and spiritual practice; they draw on the three fundamental neural functions of regulation, learning, and selection. The path of awakening involves both transforming the mind/brain and uncovering the wonderful true nature that was there all along. Small positive actions every day will add up to large changes over time, as you gradually build new neural structures. To keep at it, you need to be on your own side. Wholesome changes in the brains of many people could help tip the world in a better direction. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=403))
    - **Note:** Chapter 1 Key points
- When you understand why you feel nervous, annoyed, hassled, driven, blue, or inadequate, those feelings have less power over you. This by itself can bring some relief. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=426))
- Since we are each connected and interdependent with the world, our attempts to be separate and independent are regularly frustrated, which produces painful signals of disturbance and threat. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=482))
- Your body, brain, and mind contain vast numbers of systems that must maintain a healthy equilibrium. The problem, though, is that changing conditions continually disturb these systems, resulting in signals of threat, pain, and distress—in a word, suffering. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=488))
- Even if you do get what you want, it’s genuinely great, and it doesn’t cost much—the gold standard—every pleasant experience must inevitably change and end. Even the best ones of all. You are routinely separated from things you enjoy. And someday that separation will be permanent. Friends drift away, children leave home, careers end, and eventually your own final breath comes and goes. Everything that begins must also cease. Everything that comes together must also disperse. Experiences are thus incapable of being completely satisfying. They are an unreliable basis for true happiness. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=612))
- In the simulator, upsetting events from the past play again and again, which unfortunately strengthens the neural associations between an event and its painful feelings. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=691))
- chapter 2: Key Points Three fundamental strategies have evolved to help us pass on our genes: creating separations, stabilizing systems, and approaching opportunities while avoiding threats. Although these strategies are very effective for survival, they also make you suffer. The effort to maintain separations is at odds with the myriad ways you’re actually connected with the world and dependent upon it. As a result, you may feel subtly isolated, alienated, overwhelmed, or as if you’re in a struggle with the world. When the systems within your body, mind, and relationships become unstable, your brain produces uncomfortable signals of threat. Since everything keeps changing, these signals keep coming. Your brain colors your experiences with a feeling tone—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—so you’ll approach what’s pleasant, avoid what’s unpleasant, and move on from what’s neutral. In particular, we evolved to pay great attention to unpleasant experiences. This negativity bias overlooks good news, highlights bad news, and creates anxiety and pessimism. The brain has a wonderful capacity to simulate experiences, but there’s a price: the simulator pulls you out of the moment, plus it sets you chasing pleasures that aren’t that great and resisting pains that are exaggerated or not even real. Compassion for yourself helps reduce your suffering. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=722))
- Second darts often trigger more second darts through associative neural networks: you might feel guilt about your anger that someone moved the chair, or sadness that you feel hurt yet again by someone you love. In relationships, second darts create vicious cycles: your second-dart reactions trigger reactions from the other person, which set off more second darts from you, and so on. ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=748))
- Stress reduces serotonin, probably the most important neurotransmitter for maintaining a good mood. When serotonin drops, so does norepinephrine, which has already been diminished by glucocorticoids. In short, less serotonin means more vulnerability to a blue mood and less alert interest in the world. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=849))
- But here’s the problem: your brain preferentially scans for, registers, stores, recalls, and reacts to unpleasant experiences; as we’ve said, it’s like Velcro for negative experiences and Teflon for positive ones. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=927))
- The remedy is not to suppress negative experiences; when they happen, they happen. Rather, it is to foster positive experiences—and in particular, to take them in so they become a permanent part of you. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=934))
- Savor the experience. It’s delicious! Make it last by staying with it for 5, 10, even 20 seconds; don’t let your attention skitter off to something else. The longer that something is held in awareness and the more emotionally stimulating it is, the more neurons that fire and thus wire together, and the stronger the trace in memory ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=942))
    - **Note:** Our brain's neural network is wired in a way that lot of neurons fire easily for negative experiences. Why? This is genetically transferred to us from ancestors as part of survival instincts. Our neural nets are trained well genetically to be aware of threats. If something hurts we need to be more vigilant about that.
      Because of this wiring we are inclined to being more sad than we need to be.
      Same is not true in case of happiness. Since small happiness does not correlate to survival instincts, some of the neurons which need to fire dont fire immediately unless its sustained happiness.
      So how to you change?
      Whenever you notice a happy moment, try to consciously pause and savor for few seconds at-least. That way those neurons which are not sensitive will eventually fire and over a period of time learn/tune to fire quickly to small happiness.
      Luckily our brain is no different than a Computer's AI neural net. If you train it enough those neurons become sensitive to happiness. So in future we seem to be happy for longer durations of the day than being sad.
- To gradually replace negative implicit memories with positive ones, just make the positive aspects of your experience prominent and relatively intense in the foreground of your awareness while simultaneously placing the negative material in the background. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=998))
- Whatever their temperament, if children are part of your life, encourage them to pause for a moment at the end of the day (or at any other natural interval, such as the last minute before the school bell) to remember what went well and think about things that make them happy (e.g., a pet, their parents’ love, a goal scored in soccer). ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1039))

- Explicit memories are conscious recollections of specific events or other information. Implicit memories are residues of past experiences that largely remain below awareness but powerfully shape the inner landscape and atmosphere of your mind. Unfortunately, the bias of the brain tilts implicit memories in a negative direction, even when most of your experiences are actually positive. The first remedy is to consciously look for and take in positive experiences. There are three simple steps: turn positive facts into positive experiences, savor these experiences, and sense them sinking in. When experiences are consolidated in memory, they take with them whatever else is also in awareness, especially if it is intense. You can use this mechanism to infuse positive material into negative material; this is the second remedy. Simply have a positive experience be prominent in awareness while the painful one is sensed dimly in the background. Use this method in two ways: when you have a positive experience, help it sink into, soothe, and replace old pains; when negative material arises, bring to mind emotions and perspectives that are its antidote. Become aware of the deep roots of recurring upsets; the tips of these roots are typically lodged in childhood experiences; different upsets may have different roots. Deliberately direct positive experiences toward these roots in order to pull them out completely and stop them from growing back. Every time you take in the good, you build a little bit of neural structure. Doing this a few times a day—for months and even years—will gradually change your brain, and how you feel and act, in far-reaching ways. It’s good to take in the good. It builds up positive emotions, with many benefits for your physical and mental health. It’s a great resource for children, especially spirited or anxious ones. And it aids spiritual practice by supporting motivation, conviction, and wholeheartedness. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1049))

- The next method—diaphragm breathing—takes a minute or two. The diaphragm is the muscle beneath your lungs that helps you breathe; actively working it is particularly effective for reducing anxiety. ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1089))

- Equanimity is neither apathy nor indifference: you are warmly engaged with the world but not troubled by it. ([Location 1454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1454))
- A squirrel or sparrow has to be smarter than a lizard or shark: better able to plan, communicate, cooperate, and negotiate. These are the exact skills that human couples discover are critical when they become parents, especially if they want to remain mates. ([Location 1593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1593))
- As soon as you place anyone outside of the circle of “us,” the mind/brain automatically begins to devalue that person and justify poor treatment of him ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1721))
- Much like spikes of SNS/HPAA arousal stand out against a backdrop of resting-state parasympathetic activation, dark clouds of aggression and conflict compel more attention than the much larger “sky” of connection and love through which they pass. ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1738))
- chapter 8: Key Points Each of us has two wolves in the heart, one of love and one of hate. Everything depends on which one we feed each day. While the wolf of hate gets more press, the wolf of love is actually bigger and stronger, and its development over millions of years has been a major factor in driving the evolution of the brain. For example, mammals and birds have bigger brains than reptiles and fish in large part to manage relationships with mates and offspring. And the more sociable the primate species, the bigger the brain. The size of the human brain has tripled in the past three million years; much of this growth is devoted to interpersonal capabilities such as empathy and cooperative planning. In the harsh conditions faced by our ancestors, cooperation aided survival; thus, factors that promote cooperation have been woven into your brain. These include altruism, generosity, concern about reputation, fairness, language, forgiveness, and morality and religion. Empathy relies on three neural systems that simulate the actions, emotions, and thoughts of others. As the brain grew in size, early humans needed a longer childhood to develop and train the brain; and as childhood grew longer, our ancestors needed to find new ways to bond parents and children and other members of the band in order to preserve “the village it takes to raise a child.” Multiple neural networks accomplish this, such as reward systems based on dopamine and oxytocin and punishment systems in which social rejection creates activation much like physical pain does. Meanwhile, the wolf of hate also evolved. Hunter-gatherer bands frequently engaged in highly lethal violence toward each other. Within-group cooperation made between-group aggression more successful, and the rewards of that aggression—food, mates, survival—promoted within-group cooperation. Cooperation and aggression—love and hate—co-evolved synergistically. Their capabilities and inclinations remain within us today. The wolf of hate shrinks the circle of “us,” sometimes to the point that only the self is left inside it. The brain routinely categorizes “us” and “them,” and then automatically prefers “us” and devalues “them.” Ironically, sometimes the wolf of hate is set outside the circle of “us.” But there is no killing the wolf of hate, and denying it just lets it grow in the shadows. We need to acknowledge the wolf of hate and appreciate the power of the wolf of love—and then restrain the one while feeding the other. ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1746))
- Empathy is the foundation of any meaningful relationship. When someone empathizes with you, it gives you the sense that your inner being truly exists for that person—that ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1778))
- But if you communicate in order to fix, change, or convince another person, the success of your communications will depend on how she reacts to you, and then it’s out of your hands. Plus, the other person is likely to be more open to you if she doesn’t feel pressed to change in some way. ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1944))
- At the end of the day, what you and the other person will mainly remember is not what you said but how you said it. Be careful about your tone, and avoid language that is fault-finding, exaggerated, or inflammatory. ([Location 1946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1946))
- highly recommend the approach Marshall Rosenberg details in Nonviolent Communication (2nd Edition 2008), which has essentially three parts: When X happens [described factually, not judgmentally], I feel Y [especially the deeper, softer emotions], because I need Z [fundamental needs and wants]. ([Location 1954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1954))
- If you are solving a problem with someone, establish the facts (if you can). This usually narrows the disagreement and brings in useful information. But mainly focus on the future, not the past. Most quarrels are about the past: what happened, how bad it was, who said what, how it was said, extenuating circumstances, and so on. Instead, try to agree about how things will be from now on. Be as clear as possible. If it helps, write it down. Tacitly or explicitly, you are making agreements with each other that should be taken as seriously as commitments at work. ([Location 1963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=1963))
- We hear the word “mindful” more and more these days, but what does it actually mean? Being mindful simply means having good control over your attention: you can place your attention wherever you want and it stays there; when you want to shift it to something else, you can. ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=2247))
- Slow down. Talk less. When you can, do just one thing at a time. Reduce multitasking. Focus on your breath while doing daily activities. ([Location 2330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=2330))
    - **Note:** Simply daily routine for mindfulness
- In fact, to overcome drowsiness, it’s sometimes suggested that you literally visualize light. Neurologically, this “brightening” likely involves a surge of norepinephrine throughout the brain; that neurotransmitter—also triggered by the stress-response cascade—is a general orienting signal that fosters alertness. ([Location 2347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=2347))

- Oxygen is to the nervous system what gasoline is to your car. Although just 2 percent of body weight, your brain uses roughly 20 percent of your oxygen. By taking several deep breaths, you increase oxygen saturation in your blood and thus rev up your brain. ([Location 2349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=2349))

    - **Note:** Reason dee breadth helps
- Draw on the language centers of your brain through counting or noting the breath. For example, softly, in the back of your mind, count each breath from 1 to 10 and then start over. If you lose track, just begin again with 1. (You can also count down, from 10 to 1, starting over with 10 if you lose track.) If you’re ambitious, aim for ten sets of ten breaths counted, a hundred in all without losing track; if you like, start with your hands closed, straightening out a finger for each set of ten. This can be a great way to start a meditation, bringing your mind to a settled place quite quickly. ([Location 2458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=2458))
- The brain intensifies attention in response to novelty. So notice the individual qualities of each breath. Draw in new information by paying attention to details, such as the sensations at different spots on the upper lip. ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=2489))

    - **Note:** when there is no new information in current activity our stimulus tells brain to go look for new information elsewhere. That is when we get distracted in meditation. So try find something new in each breath to void distraction.
- Thus, the more enjoyable and intense your feelings are, the greater the dopamine release—and the more concentrated your attention. ([Location 2503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TU29WU&location=2503))
- In other words, whether you are going deep into meditative contemplation or just trying to keep your eyes open in an afternoon meeting, happiness can really help. Personally, I have found the intensification of positive emotions during meditation to be a wonderful practice: it feels great, it increases concentration, and it nourishes a strong feeling of well-being throughout the day.
