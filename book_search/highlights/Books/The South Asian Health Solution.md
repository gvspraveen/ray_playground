- Excess insulin is the underlying thread that weaves together virtually every chronic ailment currently afflicting South Asians. There is no controversy here. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=112))

- Instead of debating whether to eat a low-carb vs. low-fat meal, or vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian diet, your goal is to implement a low-insulin lifestyle ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=114))
- Your ECL is in constant contact with your blood and can detect even the subtlest chemical disturbances arising from poor nutrition or negative emotions; it responds to any damage or perceived threats by sounding the inflammation alarm. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=172))
- Looks like excess carbohydrates in an insulin resistant individual lead to high blood sugars and elevated triglyceride levels! ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=234))

- Trim your waist circumference to less than 90 cm (35 inches) in males and 80 cm (31 inches) in females • Drop your triglyceride level to less than 100 mg/dL (1.13 mmol/L) • Raise your HDL cholesterol above 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) if you’re male and above 50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) if you’re female • Reduce systolic BP (top number) at or below 120 and diastolic BP (bottom number) at or below 80 mm Hg • Decrease fasting blood glucose below 100mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and HbA1c less than 5.7% • Get hs-CRP level below 1.0 mg/dL ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=278))
- Another quick quantitative measure that can help you assess heart attack risk is the triglyceride-to-HDL ratio, which is your triglyceride level divided by your HDL level. A value less than 3.0 is associated with a low risk of insulin resistance. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=292))

- What if your grades or your paycheck depended on how healthy and fit you were? Would that get you motivated? If so, then why doesn’t the thought of having a heart attack, a stroke, a diagnosis of diabetes, premature aging, and arthritis…or the possibility of turning your kids into orphans, your spouse into a widow, and handing your loved ones the burden of having to take care of you… motivate you to take control of your health? What about the fact that your behaviors and eating habits are having an adverse effect on your children, who look to you as a role model?

- Summary • Insulin resistance is the predominant cause of heart disease and related conditions in South Asians. • Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of insulin resistant conditions that can clue you in to early heart disease risk. • Many standard risk factors and tools measured by physicians often overlook insulin resistance in South Asians. • Attack insulin resistance early at the root, rather than medicating its branches. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=455))
- There’s one other transformation that type B LDL is more likely to undergo before it inflicts damage, and that is oxidation. Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) specifically attracts the hungry immune system macrophages that gobble them up and turn them into plaque-forming foam cells. Foam cells are basically macrophages that have devoured cholesterol in the form of ox-LDL, giving them a “foamy” appearance. Foam cells also produce large amounts of a chemical called myeloperoxidase, which further oxidizes LDL particles. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=576))
- Abundant polyunsaturated fats, which come mostly in the form of vegetable oils, can also lead to increased inflammation, especially when they outnumber healthier omega-3 fats found in fish and plant-based sources. Below are some other factors that may raise the risk of LDL oxidation and overall inflammation. • Diet low in antioxidants (found in vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds) • Lack of adequate sleep (promotes systemic inflammation and compromised immune function) • Stress and related emotional disorders (anxiety, depression, etc.) • Other unhealthy lifestyle practices (smoking, inactivity, environmental pollution, and even excessive cardiovascular exercise, aka “chronic cardio” as fitness expert Mark Sisson calls it) Many of the foods we limit due to high cholesterol content, such as shrimp, eggs, and meat, typically have no adverse impact on cholesterol profiles and are far less harmful than the excessive carbohydrate sources prevalent in the South Asian diet.

- For example, I’ve had far more patients lower their triglycerides by switching their breakfasts from oatmeal or cereals, like Honey Bunches of Oats (a South Asian favorite!), to eggs. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=603))

- Recall from Chapter 1 that a typical South Asian lipid panel indicates an insulin resistant profile where HDL (good cholesterol) is low and triglycerides are high. If HDL is low, your total cholesterol number will be lower. But low HDL puts you at higher risk! If your triglyceride levels are high, they will have minimal impact on the total cholesterol, since triglycerides are divided by 5. Finally, the LDL number in insulin resistant South Asians is often lower because these individuals are plagued by the smaller, more dangerous type B LDL. Since LDL measures how much cholesterol cargo each boat carries, a smaller boat carries less cholesterol, which means LDL levels will be lower. It’s easy to see how a low total cholesterol number can be dangerously deceptive when it comes to measuring your cardiovascular risk. To summarize: Total cholesterol levels tend to be lower in South Asians due to a combination of low HDL, a triglyceride level that is divided by 5, and more dangerous small, dense LDL particles that result in a lower LDL value since they hold less cholesterol.

- You can see how high triglycerides are the initial culprit, but did you know that high carbohydrates are the major instigator of high triglycerides? Dietary cholesterol and saturated fat, on the other hand, are neutral bystanders that for years have been falsely implicated as the primary offenders in the diet-heart hypothesis. Turns out carbohydrates have been guilty all along. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=630))

- High triglycerides have become so common in South Asians that I once had a physician colleague tell me that he doesn’t worry unless the triglyceride level in his Indian patients peaks at over 300! I call this high triglyceride desensitization! Just because high triglycerides are common doesn’t mean such numbers are safe. In fact most labs to date are using 150 mg/dL as the cutoff for abnormal triglycerides. Some even use 200 mg/dL as their cutoff, which, without a doubt, places you in the danger zone. Remember: high triglycerides are the inciting event that leads to the transformation of good boats into bad ones and triggers the loss of valuable HDL. This process leads to the cholesterol hallmark of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome: high triglycerides, low HDL, and type B LDL cholesterol.

- Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio: This represents your triglyceride divided by your HDL, an excellent early marker of insulin resistance and future diabetes risk, along with associated complications such as kidney disease. This ratio becomes abnormal long before your blood sugar does. Experts agree that your ratio should be 3.0 or less. The lower the better, with 1:1 an excellent ultimate goal.

- High quality, natural, unprocessed sources of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol simply and unequivocally do not increase blood cholesterol and heart disease risk, especially when consumed in the context of a lower carbohydrate diet. • Inflammation is a far greater cause of heart disease and chronic disease than is high cholesterol. • Follow the six rules for interpreting cholesterol results to gain a better understanding of what your numbers mean. • Use the Metabolic 6-pack from Chapter 1 as a better overall assessment of heart and chronic disease risk. • Eat an antioxidant-rich diet to reduce inflammation. • Increase activity and manage stress to further reduce inflammation.

- Plant-based sources rich in potassium include spinach, broccoli, avocados, oranges, nuts, and seeds. My average South Asian patient consumes far fewer of these foods than other ethnic groups do.

- Abdominal fat is a major cause of inflammation and chronic disease in South Asians. • Visceral fat is directly correlated to heart attack risk because it releases chemicals that promote oxidation, inflammation, and coagulation. • Sarcopenia (lack of muscle) is very common in South Asians and may contribute to insulin resistance. • Body weight and BMI are less accurate than waist-based measurements (WC, WHR) when it comes to assessing risk for heart disease and other conditions. • A skinny-fat South Asian with a normal body weight and waist measurement may still have abnormal metabolic markers. • Reverse the dangerous combination of increased body fat and reduced muscle by removing excess carbs and incorporating strength training into your exercise program.

- Glucose enters the liver without the help of insulin, but once it gets inside, insulin stores it as glycogen, if there’s room. If there’s no room, the liver starts making fat. ([Location 1552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=1552))
- Fast carbs lead to a fast rise in blood sugar, a steep climb in fat-storing insulin, and rapid swings in blood glucose, manifesting as fluctuating hunger and energy. Slow carbs (in moderation) cause a steadier rise in blood sugar and a more controlled release of insulin, which keeps hunger and energy more stable.

- You may be surprised to learn that fat alone does not raise insulin levels. That’s right—fat in the absence of excess carbs and insulin is not fattening. However, if plenty of insulin is hanging around due to a high-carb diet and/or insulin resistance, then fat will hitch a ride on insulin and head straight into your fat cells, where it’s stored as triglycerides.

- Saturated fat: Found mainly in animal sources (meat, milk, butter), but also in coconut products (oil, butter, flakes, milk). Saturated fat is an efficient source of energy with assorted health benefits, and is only problematic when consumed with excess carbohydrates. Monounsaturated fats: A healthy fat found in olives and extra virgin olive oil, avocados, macadamia nuts, and almonds. Polyunsaturated fats: Omega-3s are healthy fats found in certain oils and coldwater fish (the best source). Omega-6s need to be limited (vegetable oils are the leading offender) due to inflammatory effects. Aim for an omega-6-to-omega-3 ratio of 3:1 or less. Trans fats/partially-hydrogenated fats: Chemically altered fats that are completely unfit for human consumption.

- Summary
  • In order to burn body fat, focus on tracking and controlling NC like a bank balance.
  • Use the CARBS categories to remind you which major carb sources to avoid.
  • Prioritize quitting sugar and rice, and be very wary of wheat, which can be a major source of fat storage and inflammation.
  • Track your Metabolic 6-pack before and after making dietary changes to monitor effects.
  • Be sure to add enough protein, and don’t fear fat, which in the absence of excess carbs is energizing and healthy.
  • Beware of breakfast sources that provide excess carbs. Early morning carbohydrate consumption can trigger fat storage and increase post-breakfast hunger. Don’t fear eggs, especially when you cut back on carb intake.
  • Consider incorporating intermittent fasting to accelerate fat burning. ([Location 2339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=2339))

- To help reinforce the feeding schedule, make sure meals and snacks don’t last more than 20 minutes. If your toddler refuses to eat what you have put out or begins to throw the food down, end the feed right then. Do not force feed. Once your toddler averts his head from the spoon or stops eating on his own, the meal is over. Eating should be a pleasant experience. Don’t turn meals into power struggles between toddler and parent by trying to sneak in some extra bites of food using force or tricks. Even when your child rejects his food, avoid feeding anything until the next scheduled feeding time. If your toddler rejects two to three meals in a row or eats very little, don’t succumb—stick to this plan for a few days to allow him time to adjust. During this time, he will need to stay hydrated with fluids, which can be monitored by making sure he continues to produce the usual wet diapers. He will be okay if he doesn’t eat many solids for a few days. ([Location 4105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=4105))
- Let’s summarize these principles:
  • Schedule feeding times and stick to them.
  • Encourage toddlers to sit and self-feed. Don’t chase kids with spoons and bite-sized chapati pieces!
  • Set limits—20 minutes and the meal or snack is over regardless of how much food has been eaten.
  • Don’t force feed. Feeding time should be pleasant, not a battle between parent and toddler.
  • Avoid TV and other digital distractions during feeds. ([Location 4116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=4116))

- Don’t let your child skip or skimp on breakfast. • Pack a healthy lunch, especially on days when the cafeteria options are unhealthy (this might be every day!). • Substitute fruit juices with fresh fruit. • Have children participate with meal prep. • Aim for at least four family dinners per week. • Be aware of what other family members are feeding your kids.

- Let’s summarize some of the major factors that accelerate aging: • Chronically high glucose levels from excess carbohydrates and insulin resistance (as revealed by elevated HbAlC blood tests) • High stress levels • Sedentary lifestyle • Vitamin D deficiency ([Location 4666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=4666))
- Excess belly (visceral) fat: Vitamin D is fat soluble—when it enters the body it has the tendency to migrate towards and enter into our fat cells for storage. The more fat you have, the greater the likelihood vitamin D is sequestered inside fat cells instead of available to help power essential biochemical reactions in your body.

- Vitamin D encourages weight loss by boosting metabolism and allowing you to burn rather than store fat. ([Location 4707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IOFMOYS&location=4707))
