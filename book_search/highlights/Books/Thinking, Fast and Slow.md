### Highlights

- System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

- two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=334))
- The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high. The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=406))
- Another is the prefrontal area of the brain, a region that is substantially more developed in humans than in other primates, and is involved in operations that we associate with intelligence. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=552))
- The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose. When you are actively involved in difficult cognitive reasoning or engaged in a task that requires self-control, your blood glucose level drops. The effect is analogous to a runner who draws down glucose stored in her muscles during a sprint. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=650))

- It suggests that when people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound. If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=700))
- Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=713))
- The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=891))
- beliefs. A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1001))

- impressions. How do you know that a statement is true? If it is strongly linked by logic or association to other beliefs or preferences you hold, or comes from a source you trust and like, you will feel a sense of cognitive ease. The trouble is that there may be other causes for your feeling of ease—including the quality of the font and the appealing rhythm of the prose—and you have no simple way of tracing your feelings to their source.

- exposed to the tone they had heard while inhabiting the shell. Zajonc offered an eloquent summary of his program of research: The consequences of repeated exposures benefit the organism in its relations to the immediate animate and inanimate environment. They allow the organism to distinguish objects and habitats that are safe from those that are not, and they are the most primitive basis of social attachments. Therefore, they form the basis for social organization and cohesion—the basic sources of psychological and social stability. The link between positive emotion and cognitive ease in System 1 has a long evolutionary history. Ease, Mood, and Intuition Around 1960, a young psychologist named Sarnoff Mednick thought he had identified the essence of creativity. His idea was as simple as it was powerful: creativity is associative memory that works exceptionally well. He made up a test, called the Remote Association Test (RAT), which is still often used in studies of creativity. For an easy example, consider the following three words: cottage Swiss cake ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1093))
- Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition. ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1122))
- These findings add to the growing evidence that good mood, intuition, creativity, gullibility, and increased reliance on System 1 form a cluster. At the other pole, sadness, vigilance, suspicion, an analytic approach, and increased effort also go together. A happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. Here again, as in the mere exposure effect, the connection makes biological sense. A good mood is a signal that things are generally going well, the environment is safe, and it is all right to let one’s guard down. A bad mood indicates that things are not going very well, there may be a threat, and vigilance is required. Cognitive ease is both a cause and a consequence of a pleasant feeling.

- significant: when System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything. System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.

- chance. Sequence matters, however, because the halo effect increases the weight of first impressions, sometimes to the point that subsequent information is mostly wasted. ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00555X8OA&location=1362))
- System 1 has been shaped by evolution to provide a continuous assessment of the main problems that an organism must solve to survive: How are things going? Is there a threat or a major opportunity? Is everything normal? Should I approach or avoid? The questions are perhaps less urgent for a human in a city environment than for a gazelle on the savannah, but we have inherited the neural mechanisms that evolved to provide ongoing assessments of threat level, and they have not been turned off.
