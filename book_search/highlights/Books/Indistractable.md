### Highlights

- The antidote to impulsiveness is forethought. Planning ahead ensures you will follow through. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=197))
- Even when we think we’re seeking pleasure, we’re actually driven by the desire to free ourselves from the pain of wanting. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=398))
- Simply put, the drive to relieve discomfort is the root cause of all our behavior, while everything else is a proximate cause. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=401))
- Most people don’t want to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth that distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=435))
- •    Understand the root cause of distraction. Distraction is about more than your devices. Separate proximate causes from the root cause.   •    All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort. If a behavior was previously effective at providing relief, we’re likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort.   •    Anything that stops discomfort is potentially addictive, but that doesn’t make it irresistible. If you know the drivers of your behavior, you can take steps to manage them. Chapter 4 Time Management ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=452))
- As is the case with all human behavior, distraction is just another way our brains attempt to deal with pain. If we accept this fact, it makes sense that the only way to handle distraction is by learning to handle discomfort.

- STEP 1: LOOK FOR THE DISCOMFORT THAT PRECEDES THE DISTRACTION, FOCUSING IN ON THE INTERNAL TRIGGER A common problem I have while writing is the urge to google something. ([Location 603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=603))
- Step 1. Look for the emotion preceding distraction.   •    Step 2. Write down the internal trigger.   •    Step 3. Explore the negative sensation with curiosity instead of contempt.   •    Step 4. Be extra cautious during liminal moments. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=655))
- Labeling yourself as having poor self-control actually leads to less self-control. ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=775))
- •    Reimagining our temperament can help us manage our internal triggers.   •    We don’t run out of willpower. Believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.   •    What we say to ourselves matters. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control is self-defeating.   •    Practice self-compassion. Talk to yourself the way you’d talk ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=804))
- Only by setting aside specific time in our schedules for traction (the actions that draw us toward what we want in life) can we turn our backs on distraction. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=858))
- It’s fine to watch a video, scroll social media, daydream, or take a nap, as long as that’s what you planned to do. Alternatively, checking work email, a seemingly productive task, is a distraction if it’s done when you intended to spend time with your family or work on a presentation. Keeping a timeboxed schedule is the only way to know if you’re distracted. If you’re not spending your time doing what you’d planned, you’re off track. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=871))
- You can’t call something a distraction unless you know what it is distracting you from. Planning ahead is the only way to know the difference between traction and distraction.   •    Does your calendar reflect your values? To be the person you want to be, you have to make time to live your values.   •    Timebox your day. The three life domains of you, relationships, and work provide a framework for planning how to spend your time.   •    Reflect and refine. Revise your schedule regularly, but you must commit to it once it’s set. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=907))

- The people you love deserve more than getting whatever time is left over. If someone is important to you, make regular time for them on your calendar.   •    Go beyond scheduling date days with your significant other. Put domestic chores on your calendar to ensure an equitable split.   •    A lack of close friendships may be hazardous to your health. Ensure you maintain important relationships by ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1061))
- By having your phone in your field of view, your brain must work hard to ignore it, but if your phone isn’t easily accessible or visually present, your brain is able to focus on the task at hand. ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1221))

- External triggers often lead to distraction. Cues in our environment like the pings, dings, and rings from devices, as well as interruptions from other people, frequently take us off track.   •    External triggers aren’t always harmful. If an external trigger leads us to traction, it serves us.   •    We must ask ourselves: Is this trigger serving me, or am I serving it? Then we can hack back the external triggers that don’t serve us. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1242))
- SLOW DOWN AND DELAY DELIVERY ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1377))
- Checking email isn’t so much the problem; it’s the habitual rechecking that gets us into trouble. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1408))
- Break down the problem. Time spent on email (T) is a function of the number of messages received (n) multiplied by the average time (t) spent per message: T = n × t.   •    Reduce the number of messages received. Schedule office hours, delay when messages are sent, and reduce time-wasting messages from reaching your inbox.   •    Spend less time on each message. Label emails by when each message needs a response. Reply to emails during a scheduled time on your calendar. ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1438))
- If we are going to spend our time in a meeting, we must make sure that we are present, both in body and mind. ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1532))
- Make it harder to call a meeting. To call a meeting, the organizer must circulate an agenda and briefing document.   •    Meetings are for consensus building. With few exceptions, creative problem-solving should occur before the meeting, individually or in very small groups.   •    Be fully present. People use devices during meetings to escape monotony and boredom, which subsequently makes meetings even worse.   •    Have one laptop per meeting. Devices in everyone’s hands makes it more difficult to achieve the purpose of the meeting. With the exception of one laptop in the room for presenting information and taking notes, leave devices outside. ([Location 1553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1553))
- •    You can hack back the external triggers on your phone in four steps and in less than one hour.   •    Remove: Uninstall the apps you no longer need.   •    Replace: Shift where and when you use potentially distracting apps, like social media and YouTube, to your desktop instead of on your phone. Get a wristwatch so you don’t have to look at your phone for the time.   •    Rearrange: Move any apps that may trigger mindless checking from your phone’s home screen.   •    Reclaim: Change the notification settings for each app. Be very selective regarding which apps can send you sound and sight cues. Learn to use your phone’s Do Not Disturb settings. ([Location 1652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1652))
- •    Precommitments should only be used after the other three indistractable strategies have already been applied. Don’t skip the first three steps. ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=1916))
- •    A price pact adds a cost to getting distracted. It has been shown to be a highly effective motivator.   •    Price pacts are most effective when you can remove the external triggers that lead to distraction.   •    Price pacts work best when the distraction is temporary.   •    Price pacts can be difficult to start. We fear making a price pact because we know we’ll have to actually do the thing we’re scared to do.   •    Learn self-compassion before making a price pact. ([Location 2065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=2065))
- •    Identity greatly influences our behavior. People tend to align their actions with how they see themselves.   •    An identity pact is a precommitment to a self-image. You can prevent distraction by acting in line with your identity.   •    Become a noun. By assigning yourself a moniker, you increase the likelihood of following through with behaviors consistent with what you call yourself. Call yourself “indistractable.”   •    Share with others. Teaching others solidifies your commitment, even if you’re still struggling. A great way to be indistractable is to tell friends about what you learned in this book and the changes you’re making in your life.   •    Adopt rituals. Repeating mantras, keeping a timeboxed schedule, or performing other routines reinforces your identity and influences your future actions.

- Slack’s corporate culture is an example of a work environment that hasn’t succumbed to the maddening cycle of responsiveness endemic to so many organizations today. ([Location 2390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=2390))
- Without sufficient amounts of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, kids turn to distractions for psychological nourishment. ([Location 2559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=2559))

- Internal triggers drive behavior. To understand how to help kids manage distraction, we need to start by understanding the source of the problem.  
  •    Our kids need psychological nutrients. According to a widely accepted theory of human motivation, all people need three things to thrive: a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.   
  •    Distractions satisfy deficiencies. When our kids’ psychological needs are not met in the real world, they go looking for satisfaction—often in virtual environments.   
  •    Kids need alternatives. Parents and guardians can take steps to help kids find balance between their online and offline worlds by providing more offline opportunities to find autonomy, competence, and relatedness.   
  •    The four-part Indistractable Model is valuable for kids as well. Teach them methods for handling distraction, and, most important, model being indistractable yourself. ([Location 2668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=2668))

- Empowering children with the autonomy to control their own time is a tremendous gift. Even if they fail from time to time, failure is part of the learning process. ([Location 2742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=2742))
- scheduling family meals is perhaps the single most important thing parents and kids can do together. Studies demonstrate that children who eat regularly with their families show lower rates of drug use, depression, school problems, and eating disorders.

- Distraction in social situations can keep us from being fully present with important people in our lives. Interruptions degrade our ability to form close social bonds.   •    Block the spread of unhealthy behaviors. “Social antibodies” are ways groups protect themselves from harmful behaviors by making them taboo.   •    Develop new social norms. We can tackle distraction among friends the same way we beat social smoking, by making it unacceptable to use devices in social situations. Prepare a few tactful phrases—like asking, “Is everything OK?”—to discourage phone usage among friends. ([Location 2967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PG2W6DC&location=2967))
