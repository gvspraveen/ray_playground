### Highlights

- What does it mean to play the long game? To borrow a sports metaphor, it means skating to where the puck is going, not where it’s been. In a more concrete sense, it means thinking ahead on a scale of years, decades, or even longer. It means understanding the extraordinary power of compounding—how tiny steps can add up as time passes. It means being willing to delay gratification today in favor of a bigger payoff later. It means understanding second-order effects and unintended consequences.

- People often overestimate what they can accomplish in one year. But they greatly underestimate what they could accomplish in five years. — Peter Drucker ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082P91L9Z&location=215))

- I’ve come to see that people who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects of second- and subsequent-order consequences rarely reach their goals. This is because first-order consequences often have opposite desirabilities from second-order consequences, resulting in big mistakes in decision making. For example, the first-order consequences of exercise (pain and time spent) are commonly considered undesirable, while the second-order consequences (better health and more attractive appearance) are desirable.

- Motivation is not enough.   If we want to play the long game, we need to carefully consider what fuels and motivates us, because that has a strong connection to our ability to delay gratification. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082P91L9Z&location=391))

- Successful people are those who are willing to delay gratification and make sacrifices in the short-term so that they can enjoy far greater rewards in the long-term. Unsuccessful people, on the other hand, think more about short-term pleasure and immediate gratification while giving little thought to the long-term future.

- Companies are coming round to the realization that while there will always be good and bad economic times, the pursuit of greed for short-term profits and growth can only make conditions worse for society at large. Short-termism leads to cronyism and corruption. Besides profit, organizations need other nutrients to survive and thrive, and these are what create workplaces with talented, rounded, and innovative people.
