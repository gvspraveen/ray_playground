### Highlights

- Keeping sub-purposes and overall system purposes in harmony is an essential function of successful systems. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=422))
- A change in purpose changes a system profoundly, even if every element and interconnection remains the same. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=443))
- To be a highly functional system, hierarchy must balance the welfare, freedoms, and responsibilities of the subsystems and total system—there must be enough central control to achieve coordination toward the large system goal, and enough autonomy to keep all subsystems flourishing, functioning, and self-organizing.

- Resilience, self-organization, and hierarchy are three of the reasons dynamic systems can work so well. Promoting or managing for these properties of a system can improve its ability to function well over the long term—to ([Location 1509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1509))
- If the news did a better job of putting events into historical context, we would have better behavior-level understanding, which is deeper than event-level understanding. ([Location 1574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1574))
- No physical entity can grow forever. If company managers, city governments, the human population do not choose and enforce their own limits to keep growth within the capacity of the supporting environment, then the environment will choose and enforce limits.

- Bounded rationality means that people make quite reasonable decisions based on the information they have. But they don’t have perfect information, especially about more distant parts of the system. ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1920))
- Change comes first from stepping outside the limited information that can be seen from any single place in the system and getting an overview. From a wider perspective, information flows, goals, incentives, and disincentives can be restructured so that separate, bounded, rational actions do add up to results that everyone desires. ([Location 1966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1966))

- it has been widely believed that the free, competitive market is one of these properly structured self-regulating systems. In some ways, it is. In other ways, obvious to anyone who is willing to look, it isn’t. A free market does allow producers and consumers, who have the best information about production opportunities and consumption choices, to make fairly uninhibited and locally rational decisions. But those decisions can’t, by themselves, correct the overall system’s tendency to create monopolies and undesirable side effects (externalities), to discriminate against the poor, or to overshoot its sustainable carrying capacity.

- The bounded rationality of each actor in a system may not lead to decisions that further the welfare of the system as a whole. ([Location 1999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=1999))
- Social systems are the external manifestations of cultural thinking patterns and of profound human needs, emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. Changing them is not as simple as saying “now all change,” or of trusting that he who knows the good shall do the good.

- best. We can never fully understand our world, not in the way our reductionist science has led us to expect. ([Location 3042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3042))
- Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own. Instead of becoming a champion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as many as possible. Consider all of them to be plausible until you find some evidence that causes you to rule one out. That way you will be emotionally able to see the evidence that rules out an assumption that may become entangled with your own identity.

    - **Note:** Overcoming ego in any discussion starts with understanding that your ideas and opinions are not you. A simple path to optimal decisions.
- Thou shalt not distort, delay, or withhold information. ([Location 3138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005VSRFEA&location=3138))
- What’s appropriate when you’re learning is small steps, constant monitoring, and a willingness to change course as you find out more about where it’s leading. That’s hard. It means making mistakes and, worse, admitting them. It means what psychologist Don Michael calls “error-embracing.” It takes a lot of courage to embrace your errors.
