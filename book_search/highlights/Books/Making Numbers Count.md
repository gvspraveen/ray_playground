### Highlights

- we lose information when we don’t translate numbers into instinctive human experience. We do hard, often painstaking work to generate the right numbers to help make a good decision—but all that work is wasted if those numbers never take root in the minds of the decision makers.

- Moving on the number scale from 10 to 20 feels significant. But moving an equal distance from 340 to 350, even though it’s the same increase, we feel nothing… that’s “numbing.” ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VJKX427&location=85))
- Calendar time is easier to feel than number counts. We know what a day is, and we know what a year is. Even young children know there is a lonnnnnnng time between birthday parties. Whenever we can translate a number into calendar time, we’re able to work with numbers we fundamentally understand.

- The secret to translating numbers is simple: avoid using them. Translate them into concrete, vivid, meaningful messages that are clear enough to make numbers unnecessary. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VJKX427&location=216))
- Rule #2. Concrete Is Better: Use Whole Numbers to Describe Whole Objects, Not Decimals, Fractions, or Percentages. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VJKX427&location=407))
- numbers are so foreign to us at a gut level that even the simplest numbers stand to benefit from concrete translation. We think we know what 7 years means. But we don’t really. Anything that puts a number in context magnifies the impact of that number. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VJKX427&location=683))
- Converting to time is useful in many situations because, in a world ruled by schedules, we have plenty of experience clocking it. We might not know how many kilometers away our favorite coffee spot is, but we know just how long it takes to get there.

- Our brains are complex webs of associations, and we can access a piece of info in many different ways. The more a new fact connects with the existing network of associations in our brains, the more likely we are to remember it. We might forget an anecdote about a stranger because it makes few connections with our existing associations, but we won’t forget a piece of gossip about our cousin.

- Make It Personal—Pick People in the Room Behavioral science shows that we pay much more attention when things are close by and specific. If a statistic applies to a percentage or fraction of people, it doesn’t instinctively feel real, let alone consequential. But something that’s happening to us, or the people with us, feels as real as it gets. That’s why law professors say “one of you will not make it to graduation,” instead of just citing matriculation rates. If you want an audience invested in a problem, you can use substitution and role-playing to get them to put skin in the game.

- Whole numbers are generally meaningful and strong, and when properly rounded they are the easiest numbers for our brains to process. Aim for simple, clean, whole numbers unless you’re catering to learned cultural tools. ([Location 1781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08VJKX427&location=1781))
