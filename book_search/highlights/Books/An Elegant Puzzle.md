### Highlights

- Keep innovation and maintenance together. A frequent practice is to spin up a new team to innovate while existing teams are bogged down in maintenance. I’ve historically done this myself, but I’ve moved toward innovating within existing teams.5 This requires very deliberate decision-making and some bravery, but in exchange you’ll get higher morale and a culture of learning, and will avoid creating a two-tiered class system of innovators and maintainers.

- Teams are slotted into a continuum of four states: A team is falling behind if each week their backlog is longer than it was the week before. Typically, people are working extremely hard but not making much progress, morale is low, and your users are vocally dissatisfied. A team is treading water if they’re able to get their critical work done, but are not able to start paying down technical debt or begin major new projects. Morale is a bit higher, but people are still working hard, and your users may seem happier because they’ve learned that asking for help won’t go anywhere. A team is repaying debt when they’re able to start paying down technical debt, and are beginning to benefit from the debt repayment snowball: each piece of debt you repay leads to more time to repay more debt. A team is innovating when their technical debt is sustainably low, morale is high, and the majority of work is satisfying new user needs. Teams want to climb from falling behind to innovating, while entropy drags them backward. Each state requires a different tact.

- Adding new individuals to a team disrupts that team’s gelling process, so I’ve found it much easier to have rapid growth periods for any given team, followed by consolidation/gelling periods during which the team gels. The organization will never stop growing, but each team will. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=329))
- Fundamentally, I believe that sustained productivity comes from high-performing teams, and that disassembling a high-performing team leads to a significant loss of productivity, even if the members are fully retained. In this worldview, high-performing teams are sacred, and I’m quite hesitant to disassemble them. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=344))

- that you only get value from projects when they finish: to make progress, above all else, you must ensure that some of your projects finish. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=467))
- Finally, the one thing that I’ve found at companies with very few interruptions and have observed almost nowhere else: really great, consistently available documentation. It’s probably even harder to bootstrap documentation into a non-documenting company than it is to bootstrap unit tests into a non-testing company, but the best solution to frequent interruptions I’ve seen is a culture of documentation, documentation reading, and a documentation search that actually works.

- Take a look at your calendar and write down your role in meetings. This goes for explicit roles, like owning a meeting’s agenda, and also for more nuanced roles, like being the first person to champion others’ ideas, or the person who is diplomatic enough to raise difficult concerns. Take a second pass on your calendar for non-meeting stuff, like interviewing and closing candidates. Look back over the past six months for recurring processes, like roadmap planning, performance calibrations, or head count decisions, and document your role17 in each of those processes. For each of the individuals you support, in which areas are your skills and actions most complementary to theirs? How do you help them? What do they rely on you for? Maybe it’s authorization, advice navigating the organization, or experience in the technical domain. Audit inbound chats and emails for requests and questions coming your way. If you keep a to-do list, look at the categories of the work you’ve completed over the past six months, as well as the stuff you’ve been wanting to do but keep putting off. Think through the external relationships that have been important for you in your current role. What kinds of folks have been important, and who are the strategic partners that someone needs to know? After exploring each of these avenues, you’ll have quite a long list of things. Test the list on a few folks whom you work closely with and see if you’ve missed anything. Congratulations, now you know what your job is! ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=560))
- Product management is an iterative elimination tournament, with each round consisting of problem discovery, problem selection, and solution validation. Problem discovery is uncovering possible problems to work on, problem selection is filtering those problems down to a viable subset, and solution validation is ensuring that your approach to solving those problems works as cheaply as possible.

- Strategies are grounded documents which explain the trade-offs and actions that will be taken to address a specific challenge. Visions are aspirational documents that enable individuals who don’t work closely together to make decisions that fit together cleanly.

- Migrations are both essential and frustratingly frequent as your codebase ages and your business grows: most tools and processes only support about one order of magnitude of growth22 before becoming ineffective, so rapid growth makes migrations a way of life. This isn’t because you have bad processes or poor tools—quite the opposite. The fact that something stops working at significantly increased scale is a sign that it was designed appropriately to the previous constraints rather than being over-designed.23 As ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=966))

- Migrations are the only mechanism to effectively manage technical debt as your company and code grow. If you don’t get effective at software and system migrations, you’ll end up languishing in technical debt. (And you’ll still have to do one later anyway, it’s just that it’ll probably be a full rewrite.) ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=985))
- Running good migrations The good news is that while migrations are hard, there is a pretty standard playbook that works remarkably well: de-risk, enable, then finish. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=988))

- When I started managing, my leadership philosophy was simple: The Golden Rule6 makes a lot of sense. Give everyone an explicit area of ownership that they are responsible for. Reward and status should derive from finishing high-quality work. Lead from the front, and never ask anyone to do something you wouldn’t.

- I believe that management, at its core, is an ethical profession. To see ourselves, we don’t look at the mirror, but rather at how we treat a member of the team who is not succeeding. Not at the mirror, but at our compensation philosophy. Not at the mirror, but at how we pitch the roles to candidates. Whom we promote. How we assign raises. Provide growth opportunities. PTO requests. Working hours. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=1677))

- Strong relationships > any problem I believe that almost every internal problem can be traced back to a missing or poor relationship, and that with great relationships it is possible to come together and solve almost anything.

- 4.3.4 Do the hard thing now In this profession, we’re often asked to deal with difficult situations. No set of rules can guide you safely through every scenario, but I have found that postponement is never the best solution.

- 4.3.5 Your company, your team, yourself Lately, I’ve come to have something of a mantra for guiding decisionmaking: do the right thing for the company, the right thing for the team, and the right thing for yourself, in that order. This is pretty obvious on some levels, but I’ve found it to be a useful thinking aid. ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=1708))
