### Highlights

- “If you could get all the people in an organization rowing in the same direction, you could dominate any industry, in any market, against any competition, at any time.” ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006960LQW&location=249))
- the lack of conflict that’s a problem. Harmony itself is good, I suppose, if it comes as a result of working through issues constantly and cycling through conflict. But if it comes only as a result of people holding back their opinions and honest concerns, then it’s a bad thing. I’d trade that false kind of harmony any day for a team’s willingness to argue effectively about an issue and then walk away with no collateral damage.” ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006960LQW&location=1203))

- Consensus. Great teams understand the danger of seeking consensus, and find ways to achieve buy-in even when complete agreement is impossible. They understand that reasonable human beings do not need to get their way in order to support a decision, but only need to know that their opinions have been heard and considered. Great teams ensure that everyone's ideas are genuinely considered, which then creates a willingness to rally around whatever decision is ultimately made by the group. And when that is not possible due to an impasse, the leader of the team is allowed to make the call. ([Location 2572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006960LQW&location=2572))
- Certainty. Great teams also pride themselves on being able to unite behind decisions and commit to clear courses of action even when there is little assurance about whether the decision is correct. That's because they understand the old military axiom that a decision is better than no decision. They also realize that it is better to make a decision boldly and be wrong—and then change direction with equal boldness—than it is to waffle.

- the leader must be comfortable with the prospect of making a decision that ultimately turns out to be wrong. And the leader must be constantly pushing the group for closure around issues, as well as adherence to schedules that the team has set. What the leader cannot do is place too high a premium on certainty or consensus. ([Location 2629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006960LQW&location=2629))

- Success is not a matter of mastering subtle, sophisticated theory, but rather of embracing common sense with uncommon levels of discipline and persistence. ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B006960LQW&location=2743))
