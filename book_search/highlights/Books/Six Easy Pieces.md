### Highlights

- Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation to the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it. In fact, everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=384))
- all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=416))
- the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004OVEYNU&location=438))
