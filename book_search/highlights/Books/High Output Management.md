- The key to survival is to learn to add more value—and that ultimately is what this book is about. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015VACHOK&location=246))
- A manager’s output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015VACHOK&location=290))
- As a means to obtain this leverage, a manager must understand, as Andy writes: “When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.” This insight enables a manager to dramatically focus her efforts. All you can do to improve the output of an employee is motivate and train. There is nothing else. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015VACHOK&location=297))
- If you only understand one thing about building products, you must understand that energy put in early in the process pays off tenfold and energy put in at the end of the program pays off negative tenfold. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015VACHOK&location=303))
