### Highlights

- Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues have shown that what we remember about the pleasurable quality of our past experiences is almost entirely determined by two things: how the experiences felt when they were at their peak (best or worst), and how they felt when they ended.

- So it seems that neither our predictions about how we will feel after an experience nor our memories of how we did feel during the experience are very accurate reflections of how we actually do feel while the experience is occurring. And yet it is memories of the past and expectations for the future that govern our choices. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TDGGVU&location=674))
- The availability heuristic says that we assume that the more available some piece of information is to memory, the more frequently we must have encountered it in the past. This heuristic is partly true. In general, the frequency of experience does affect its availability to memory. But frequency of experience is not the only thing that affects availability to memory. Salience or vividness matters as well. Because starting letters ([Location 756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TDGGVU&location=756))
- “law of diminishing marginal utility.” As the rich get richer, each additional unit of wealth satisfies them less. With ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TDGGVU&location=898))
- Some studies have estimated that losses have more than twice the psychological impact as equivalent gains. The fact is, we all hate to lose, which Kahneman and Tversky refer to as loss aversion. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TDGGVU&location=916))
- Aversion to losses also leads people to be sensitive to what are called “sunk costs.” ([Location 948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TDGGVU&location=948))
- Happy people have the ability to distract themselves and move on, whereas unhappy people get stuck ruminating and make themselves more and more miserable. ([Location 2526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TDGGVU&location=2526))
- Learning to accept “good enough” will simplify decision making and increase satisfaction. Though satisficers may often do less well than maximizers according to certain objective standards, nonetheless, by settling for “good enough” even when the “best” could be just around the corner, satisficers will usually feel better about the decisions they make.

- We can vastly improve our subjective experience by consciously striving to be grateful more often for what is good about a choice or an experience, and to be disappointed less by what is bad about it. ([Location 2903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000TDGGVU&location=2903))
