### Highlights

- Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. Marie Curie1 ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=120))
- The theory of relativity is founded on empathy. Not empathy in the ordinary emotional sense; empathy in a rigorous scientific sense. The crucial idea is to imagine how things would appear to someone who’s moving in a different way than you are.» ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=131))
- When you see someone doing something that doesn’t make sense to you, ask yourself what the world would have to look like to you for those actions to make sense. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=252))
- Perspective often comes from distance or time. If you’re trying to solve a problem and you’re stuck, try shifting your vantage point. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=294))
- We all get stuck, frustrated when no one seems to understand us, or angry that we aren’t making progress based on how we understand the world. This is when it is most helpful to remember relativity and refresh our perspective by stepping outside of ourselves for a little bit. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=303))
- The trick is to start looking at outcomes in the aggregate instead of focusing on each unique situation. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=428))
- Become what you want to see in the world and it will be so. If you want an amazing relationship with your partner, be an amazing partner. If you want people to be thoughtful and kind, be thoughtful and kind. If you want people to listen to you, listen to them. The best way to achieve success is to deserve success. Small changes in your actions change your entire world. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=499))
- course, total equilibrium means no life, so the place where there is no difference in anything is the place where everything rests. Thus, while pursuing difference is worthwhile and necessary, it’s important to understand that any barrier you try to erect will face a relentless pressure to attain equilibrium. Therefore, it’s important to remember that it takes a lot of work to maintain separation. Entropy is a similar constant. The end state of high entropy is also incompatible with life. Sensing this, we try to understand randomness and the unexplainable through stories that seem to put order back into our lives, thereby reducing entropy. Narratives are important.

- « For, like a mass in Newton’s first law of motion, once our minds are set in a direction, they tend to continue in that direction unless acted on by some outside force. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=750))

- Energy is precious and we employ it sparingly. It’s human nature to allow the current state to remain as changing it requires us to expend energy. Getting started is the hardest part. Once something is moving in a direction, it’s much easier to keep it in motion. But once something is in motion, it’s hard to stop. The bigger the mass the more effort required. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=909))
- To overcome resistance, we often default to using more force when simply reducing the friction or viscosity will do. Doing both is more effective than either in isolation. ([Location 1065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=1065))
- Better go the right direction slowly than the wrong direction with speed. ([Location 1163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=1163))
- Leverage should be applied with conscious thought as to when it’s helping you achieve your aims and when iit’s hurting your ability to do so. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=1230))
- Leverage is best paired with reciprocity—building in win-win thinking helps you keep your leverage sustainable and achieve better, longer lasting, outcomes. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=1368))

- No innovation comes into existence perfectly hewn. Error is thus necessary for the generation of variation. » ([Location 2151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=2151))
- scientific work must not be considered from the point of view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit for humanity. » Marie Curie28 ([Location 2213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=2213))
- it’s not strength that survives, but adaptability. Strength becomes rigidity. Eventually your competitors will match your strength or find innovative ways to neutralize it. Real success comes from being flexible enough to change, to let go of what worked in the past, and to focus on what you need to thrive in the future.

- We need to take the time to learn how the components of our system are interconnected so we can understand how our actions will impact the connections and affect the outcome we are trying to produce. ([Location 2485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=2485))
- There are four elements of commander’s intent: formulate, communicate, interpret, and implement. The first two are the responsibility of the senior commander, the latter two the job of the subordinate commander. In order to develop these skills commanders must consider four criteria: Explain the rationale (not just the what and why, but how they arrived at a decision) Establish operational limits (identify what is completely off the table) Get feedback often (a continuous loop between levels) Recognize individual differences (the unique psychological makeup of each subordinate)14 ([Location 2952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=2952))
- Boss vs. Leader There is a nuance here between authority and leadership. Those at the tops of hierarchies have authority that they are expected to use to solve problems and address issues facing the hierarchy. But as Ronald Heifetz points out in his article Leadership,1 we can easily think of examples of people with lots of authority who don’t actually lead or who don’t have the solutions in times of crisis, and lots of people who exhibit leadership without having any authority.

- “A general ‘law of least effort’ applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature.” ([Location 3598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=3598))
- Sometimes our tendency to conserve energy helps us, and sometimes it hurts us. While minimizing our output ensures we will have extra to draw on in times of increased need, it can also get in the way of learning. Experience doesn’t become learning without reflection, and reflection is an energy expenditure. If we want to develop our thinking and get the most out of our environments, then we have to be aware of the natural tendency to minimize energy output and correct for it where doing so creates value. ([Location 3656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=3656))
- While most people assume that experience is the key to learning, the key is actually reflection. ([Location 3670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B085HY11NF&location=3670))
