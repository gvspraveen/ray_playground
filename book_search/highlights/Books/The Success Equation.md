### Highlights

- The key to statistical prediction is to figure out how much weight you should assign to the base rate and specific case. If the expected accuracy of the prediction is low, you should place most of the weight on the base rate. If the expected accuracy is high, you can rely more on the specific case. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=156))
- When skill plays the prime role in determining what happens, you can rely on specific evidence. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=161))
- When we make predictions, we often fail to recognize the existence of luck, and as a consequence we dwell too much on the specific evidence, especially recent evidence. This also makes it tougher to judge performance. Once something has happened, our natural inclination is to come up with a cause to explain the effect. The problem is that we commonly twist, distort, or ignore the role that luck plays in our successes and failures. Thinking explicitly about how luck influences our lives can help offset that cognitive bias. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=165))

- Luck is a chance occurrence that affects a person or a group (e.g., a sports team or a company). Luck can be good or bad. Furthermore, if it is reasonable to assume that another outcome was possible, then a certain amount of luck is involved. In this sense, luck is out of one's control and unpredictable. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=266))
- Randomness and luck are related, but there is a useful distinction between the two. You can think of randomness as operating at the level of a system and luck operating at the level of the individual. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=298))
- The lack of quality feedback wreaks psychological havoc, too, creating false doubt in skillful people who are making good decisions and creating false confidence in those who are doing well simply because they're experiencing a streak of good luck. In considering ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=398))
- Here's the main point: if you have an activity where the results are nearly all skill, you don't need a large sample to draw reasonable conclusions. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=461))
- Our minds have an amazing ability to create a narrative that explains the world around us, an ability that works particularly well when we already know the answer. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=564))
- There are a couple of essential ingredients in this ability: our love of stories and our need to connect cause and effect. The blend of those two ingredients leads us to believe that the past was inevitable and to underestimate what else might have happened. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=565))
- The need to connect cause and effect is deeply ingrained in the human mind. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=589))
- even if we acknowledge ahead of time that an event will combine skill and luck in some measure, once we know how things turned out, we have a tendency to forget about luck. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=633))
- Jerker Denrell, a professor of strategy at Oxford, calls this the undersampling of failure. He argues that one of the main ways that companies learn is by observing the performance and characteristics of successful organizations. The problem is that firms with poor performance are unlikely to survive, so they are inconspicuously absent from the group that any one person observes. Say two companies pursue the same strategy, and one succeeds because of luck while the other fails. Since we draw our sample from the outcome, not the strategy, we observe the successful company and assume that the strategy was good. In other words, we assume that the favorable outcome was the result of a skillful strategy and overlook the influence of luck. We connect cause and effect where there is no connection.14 We don't observe the unsuccessful company because it no longer exists. If we had observed it, we would have seen the same strategy failing rather than succeeding and realized that copying the strategy blindly might not work. ([Location 653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=653))
- When luck plays a part in determining the consequences of your actions, you don't want to study success to learn what strategy was used but rather study strategy to see whether it consistently led to success. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=669))
- The effort of untangling skill from luck, even with its practical difficulties, still yields great value when we are trying to improve the way we make decisions. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=776))
- Slow reversion is consistent with activities dominated by skill, while rapid reversion comes from luck being the more dominant influence. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1137))
- The good news is that crystallized intelligence tends to improve with age. There is something to the idea that older people are wiser than young people because they know more. The mean scores in tests of vocabulary, synonyms, and antonyms for people aged seventy-five to ninety-seven exceeded those of subjects who were twenty-five to forty-five years old by 25 percent or more.17 Growing knowledge compensates for a reduction in fluidity, up to a certain age. Beyond that age, aggregate cognitive performance declines. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1546))
- decisions. Keith Stanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, distinguishes between an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) and rationality quotient (RQ). While many people assume that intelligence and rationality are related, Stanovich shows that these are distinct abilities. This is why we see objectively intelligent people make poor decisions. If we are considering cognitive skill, RQ is primarily what we are after. The trouble is, we haven't made very much progress in learning how to test RQ. The attributes of RQ, as Stanovich lists them, include “adaptive behavioral acts, judicious decision making, efficient behavioral regulation, sensible goal prioritization, reflectivity, [and] the proper calibration of evidence.”22 He argues that plenty of people have adequate intelligence but an inability to think and behave rationally. The gap between IQ and RQ is the result of trouble with mental processing and limits to what we know. ([Location 1579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1579))

- The natural tendency when solving problems is to rely on cognitive mechanisms that are fast, low in computational power, and require little concentration, rather than recruiting those mechanisms of the mind that are slow, computationally intensive, and that require effort. ([Location 1595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1595))
- To use Stanovich's phrase, we are “cognitive misers.”23 Another characteristic of a cognitive miser is the tendency to reason from an egocentric point of view. This bias leads to systematic and predictable departures from rationality. The ability to avoid thinking like a cognitive miser has a correlation with IQ that is only in the range of 20 to 30 percent. So you can be smart and still make this mistake.24 Conversely, you don't need the IQ of a genius to make good decisions. ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1597))

- A low RQ also stems from the issue of what we don't know. ([Location 1602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1602))
- Skill does play a role in success and failure, but it can be overwhelmed by the influence of luck. ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1786))
- Since skill alone clearly cannot explain power laws, we need to turn to the mechanisms that generate those lopsided outcomes. ([Location 1805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1805))
- A simple one is known as preferential attachment. Let's ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1820))
- That resulted in what's known as demand-side economies of scale, where more value for the consumer leads to more demand for the software and, ultimately, more profit for the producer. ([Location 1876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1876))
- We are very good at fooling ourselves about our own success, a phenomenon that psychologists call the self-serving attribution bias. It is common for us to attribute success to our own terrific skill, even in endeavors that are determined mostly by luck. Part of the explanation is that we see ourselves as capable agents. We can do things. We can make things happen. So we assume that our skill caused the success we experience. On the other hand, we readily attribute failure to external causes, including bad luck.28 ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=1996))
- The approach you take to developing skill depends on where an activity lies on the luck-skill continuum. ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2337))
- Kahneman suggests that it is useful to consider two systems of decision making. System 1, the experiential system, “operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.” System 2, the analytical system, “allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.” System 1 is difficult to modify or direct, while you can deliberately engage System 2. The distinction between these two systems of thinking is useful in considering how deliberate practice can shape performance. Kahneman explains how the two systems typically interact: Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever you are awake. System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine—usually.7 ([Location 2364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2364))
- Deliberate practice is powerful in domains where it applies, including chess, music, and sports. But acknowledging its limits is crucial. A number of the popular books that celebrate deliberate practice fail to distinguish between when it works and when it doesn't. ([Location 2391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2391))
- And as Kahneman points out, our natural tendency is to rely on the easy, automatic routines of System 1 and avoid the effortful actions of System 2. Our minds are naturally lazy. ([Location 2414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2414))
- When Success Is Probabilistic, Focus on Process ([Location 2524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2524))
- analysis, psychology, and the influences exerted by your organization. ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2543))
- The second part of a skillful process is psychological. This part deals with Kahneman and Tversky's work on biases. These include overconfidence, anchoring, confirmation, and relying on what is most recent. Kahneman and Tversky emphasize that these biases arise automatically and are therefore very difficult to overcome.31 ([Location 2584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2584))
- Kahneman and Tversky also developed the idea of prospect theory, or how people make decisions when they are uncertain about gains and losses. Prospect theory reveals behavior that is at odds with classical economic theory.32 Compensation provides a good example of the difference between these two theories. Ideally, you should consider your salary for a new job in the context of your aggregate wealth rather than comparing it with what other employees are making. But, of course, few of us do that. In one study, researchers asked people which new employee was happier, the person making $36,000 in a firm where the average starting salary is $40,000 or the one making $34,000 in a firm where the average starting salary is $30,000. Eighty percent of the respondents said the employee earning $34,000 would be happier.33 In investing, the reference point is what you paid for a stock. When you buy a stock at $30, for instance, you effectively open a mental account. You have a gain if the stock rises above $30 and a loss if it drops below that price. Rather than viewing the value of the stock in the context of a larger portfolio, the natural tendency is to consider each stock relative to its reference point. Loss aversion is another feature of prospect theory. We suffer roughly two times more from a loss than we enjoy a gain of the same size. The combination of the reference point and loss aversion leads investors to hold on to losing stocks and sell winners, because it is painful to take losses.34 ([Location 2590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2590))
- “Have the courage of your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—even though others may hesitate or differ.” ([Location 2611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2611))
- two of those areas, but very few can master all three. This fits with the conclusion of our analysis of skill and luck in investing: different people have different abilities, but only a handful of investors can surmount the analytical, psychological, and organizational hurdles. The same is true in both sports and business. ([Location 2641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2641))
- Whether or not you can improve your skill depends a great deal on where the activity lies on the luck-skill continuum. In cases where there is a clear relationship between cause and effect, and in activities that are stable and linear, deliberate practice is the only path to improvement. Expertise exists, and you can reliably develop your intuition by training your System 1 so that the decisions you make take place smoothly and automatically. Checklists can be useful when you need to perform tasks accurately and consistently (DO-CONFIRM). They can also guide decisions when unusual circumstances arise (READ-DO). Near the skill side of the continuum, the quality of your performance provides dependable feedback on your progress when you're trying to improve your skill. If an activity involves luck, then how well you do in the short run doesn't tell you much about your skill, because you can do everything right and still fail, or you can do everything wrong and succeed. For activities near the luck side of the continuum, a good process is the surest path to success in the long run. ([Location 2644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2644))
- Accurate feedback is essential no matter where you are on the continuum. Improving your skill means constantly looking for ways to change your behavior, either because what you're doing is wrong or because there's a slightly better way of doing it. This is true whether you are a basketball player shooting free throws, a doctor performing surgery, an executive making acquisitions, or an investor buying stocks. No matter what your profession or level of expertise, the chances are very good that accurate feedback can improve your performance. ([Location 2652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2652))
- When competing one-on-one, follow two simple rules: If you are the favorite, simplify the game. If you are the underdog, make it more complicated. ([Location 2683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2683))
- By definition, luck is something that no one can control. But there are ways that you can manage it more effectively. The main lesson from Colonel Blotto is that in competitive interactions, the strong should seek to simplify to emphasize their advantage in skill and the weak should try to add randomness to dilute the stronger player's advantage. This approach has proved useful in sports, business, and war, and yet many people fail to use it because of tradition, a lack of awareness, or because they are afraid of damaging their careers by doing something different and then failing. ([Location 2939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=2939))
- Perhaps the largest impediment to thinking clearly about skill and luck is our innate desire to identify cause and effect. ([Location 3206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3206))
- Other psychological tricks we play on ourselves include the recency bias and sample size bias. The recency bias says that we weight recent information more heavily than a body of past evidence. As a result, we tend to overrate players who have done well recently even if they did poorly in the past. Sample size bias is related. The natural tendency is to extract more meaning from small samples than the data warrant. Psychologists who study these biases can teach us a great deal ([Location 3211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3211))
- Deliberate practice works when skill dominates, while a focus on process and probability is appropriate when luck is the greater force. Further, an appreciation for reversion to the mean allows us to make a more thoughtful assessment of what will happen next. ([Location 3222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3222))
- Here are ten suggestions to improve the art of good guesswork in a world that combines skill and luck. 1. Understand where you are on the luck-skill continuum ([Location 3230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3230))
- The location of an activity on the continuum provides guidance on how much reversion to the mean is necessary in making your predictions. High correlations imply limited reversion to the mean; the best estimate for the next outcome is something close to the previous one. Low correlations require substantial reversion to the mean, and the most logical guess for the next outcome is the average. Psychologists have demonstrated that we typically fail to regress to the mean as much as we should. ([Location 3241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3241))
- Assess sample size, significance, and swans ([Location 3251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3251))
- Always consider a null hypothesis ([Location 3299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3299))
- 4. Think carefully about feedback and rewards ([Location 3333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3333))
- As chapter 8 demonstrated, deliberate practice is essential to improving your performance in activities where luck plays a weak role. In reality, only a small percentage of people achieve expertise through deliberate practice. One reason is that many of us hit performance plateaus and are satisfied to stay there. ([Location 3336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3336))
- Deliberate practice requires individuals to work just beyond their true ability. Deliberate practice also requires lots of timely and accurate feedback. It is hard work. It is tedious. The fact is that few of us are surrounded by coaches who can deliver a proper program with feedback, and we are not generally motivated to commit thousands of hours to mastering a given skill. Still, we need to keep the notion of deliberate practice in mind, whether we're coaching our child's sports team or training corporate executives. ([Location 3343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3343))
- In activities where luck plays a strong role, the focus must be on process. Where skill dominates, performance is a dependable barometer of progress. But where luck is a stronger force, the link between process and outcome is broken. A good process can lead to a bad outcome some percentage of the time, and a bad process can lead to a good outcome. Since a good process offers the highest probability of a good outcome over time, the emphasis has to be on process. As we have ([Location 3347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3347))
- Make use of counterfactuals ([Location 3384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3384))
- Once we know what happened, hindsight bias naturally envelops us. This is a bias that allows us to forget how unpredictable the world looked beforehand. So we come up with reasons to explain the outcomes that appear as if they were inevitable. One way to avoid hindsight bias is to engage in counterfactual thinking, a careful consideration of what could have happened but didn't. If we accept that x played a role in causing y, then we have to consider how events would have unfolded had x not happened. ([Location 3386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3386))
- 6. Develop aids to guide and improve your skill ([Location 3402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3402))
- For instance, we tend to be overconfident in our ability to make predictions. So we have to slow down and make sure that we are considering alternatives—not just what did happen but what might have happened—in a sufficiently wide range. ([Location 3413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3413))
- Have a plan for strategic interactions ([Location 3448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3448))
- 8. Make reversion to the mean work for you ([Location 3461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3461))
- Develop useful statistics ([Location 3482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3482))
- Know your limitations ([Location 3500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A07FR4W&location=3500))
- Another source of limitation is that things change. The rules of a game may evolve, a new regulation may be instituted, or the behavior of a crowd might go from wise to mad. In environments that are stable, we can develop our skills and make sound predictions. But the more things change, the less weight we can place on the past. Placement on the luck-skill continuum helps guide this thinking, but managing change is difficult nonetheless. Finally, there is a realm where statistical methods don't apply. We can define the attributes of this realm—complex payoff and extreme outcomes—and learn to cope with it. But we must be careful to avoid using methods that are not suited to the task. Most of the big blowups in finance are a consequence of naively applying statistical methods to the world of black swans.
