### Highlights

- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.

- Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

    - **Note:** Work on becoming person who deserves your goals
- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=347))

- Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=359))

- Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=361))

- Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=380))

- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=389))
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=403))

- True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=472))
- Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=499))
- “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.” ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=610))

- With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=873))
- The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious. The two most common cues are time and location. Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]. ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1011))
- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time. Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues. ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1143))

- The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible. Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1210))

- 1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.
  1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”
  1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
  1.4: Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible. ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1216))

- 1.5: Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment. ([Location 1226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1226))

- Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.” ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1358))
- The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]. ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1362))

- The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. ([Location 1379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1379))

- It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.” ([Location 1678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1678))
    - **Tags:** #habits, #favorite
- The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy. The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, not being in motion. Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it. ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1743))
- energy! In the beginning, when you’re motivated and excited, you can muster the strength to get started. But after a few days, such a massive effort feels exhausting. Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost no energy to get started. ([Location 1781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1781))
    - **Note:** true for any goal
- Certainly, you are capable of doing very hard things. The problem is that some days you feel like doing the hard work and some days you feel like giving in. On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many things working in your favor as possible so that you can overcome the challenges life naturally throws your way. The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run. ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1792))

    - **Note:** No matter how steep your goal is, we need to make daily targets/habits as easy as possible. that way they are easy to persist over longer term
- Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. Prime your environment to make future actions easier. ([Location 1873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1873))

- The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away. And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy. ([Location 1923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1923))
    - **Note:** if the initial few minutes of habit are easy, then we can easily convince ourself to get started.. rest of the few minutes can be hard. but its okay because once we get started even harder stuff feels not so hard.
      Think about high intensity workout. once you are warmed up after first 5 mins, we somehow get through it. problem is initial interia to get started
- Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward. Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist. ([Location 1999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1999))

- The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits. Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time. Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior. ([Location 2104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2104))
- 3.1: Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits. 3.2: Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier. 3.3: Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact. 3.4: Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less. 3.5: Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior. ([Location 2120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2120))

- With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. ([Location 2223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2223))
- Here’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is the wise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t. ([Location 2243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2243))
- The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. ([Location 2282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2282))
- The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. ([Location 2375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2375))
- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress. A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.

- The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. ([Location 2724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2724))
- The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.

- Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.

- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors. Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it. ([Location 2939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2939))
