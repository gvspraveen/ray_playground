### Highlights

- It’s easy to lie with statistics, but it’s hard to tell the truth without them. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007Q6XLF2&location=161))
- With both statistics and crime, the bad guys often know exactly what they’re doing! ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007Q6XLF2&location=1089))
- you should always insure yourself against any adverse contingency that you cannot comfortably afford to withstand. You should skip buying insurance on everything else. ([Location 1492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007Q6XLF2&location=1492))

- Probability gives us tools for dealing with life’s uncertainties. You shouldn’t play the lottery. You should invest in the stock market if you have a long investment horizon (because stocks typically have the best long-term returns). You should buy insurance for some things, but not others. Probability can even help you maximize your winnings on game shows (as the next chapter will show.) That said (or written), probability is not deterministic. No, you shouldn’t buy a lottery ticket—but you still might win money if you do. And yes, probability can help us catch cheaters and criminals—but when used inappropriately it can also send innocent people to jail.

- it is not the stress associated with major responsibilities that will kill you; it is the stress associated with being told what to do while having little say in how or when it gets done. ([Location 3190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007Q6XLF2&location=3190))
- Regression analysis is like one of those fancy power tools. It is relatively easy to use, but hard to use well—and potentially dangerous when used improperly. ([Location 3222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007Q6XLF2&location=3222))
- “The one social factor that researchers agree is consistently linked to longer lives in every country where it has been studied is education. It is more important than race; it obliterates any effects of income.” ([Location 3944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007Q6XLF2&location=3944))
- Math cannot supplant judgment. In that vein, let’s finish the book with some word association: fire, knives, automobiles, hair removal cream. Each one of these things serves an important purpose. Each one makes our lives better. And each one can cause some serious problems when abused. Now you can add statistics to that list. Go forth and use data wisely and well!
