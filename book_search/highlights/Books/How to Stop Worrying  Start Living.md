- “I probably would never have been able to do this if I had kept on worrying, because one of the worst features about worrying is that it destroys our ability to concentrate. When we worry, our minds jump here and there and everywhere, and we lose all power of decision. However, when we force ourselves to face the worst and accept it mentally, we then eliminate all these vague imaginings and put ourselves in a position in which we are able to concentrate on our problem.

- “True peace of mind,” said this Chinese philosopher, “comes from accepting the worst. Psychologically, I think, it means a release of energy.” ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NCV2RIR&location=422))
- If you have a worry problem, apply the magic formula of Willis H. Carrier by doing these three things— Ask yourself, “What is the worst that can possibly happen?” Prepare to accept it if you have to. Then calmly proceed to improve on the worst.

- “that if a man will devote his time to securing facts in an impartial, objective way, his worries will usually evaporate in the light of knowledge.” ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NCV2RIR&location=704))
- When trying to get the facts, I pretend that I am collecting this information not for myself, but for some other person. This helps me to take a cold, impartial view of the evidence. This helps me eliminate my emotions. While trying to collect the facts about the problem that is worrying me, I sometimes pretend that I am a lawyer preparing to argue the other side of the issue. In other words, I try to get all the facts against myself—all the facts that are damaging to my wishes, all the facts I don’t like to face.

- “A problem well stated is a problem half solved.” ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NCV2RIR&location=732))
- “Experience has proved to me, time after time, the enormous value of arriving at a decision. It is the failure to arrive at a fixed purpose, the inability to stop going round and round in maddening circles, that drives men to nervous breakdowns and living hells. I find that fifty per cent of my worries vanishes once I arrive at a clear, definite decision; and another forty per cent usually vanishes once I start to carry out that decision. ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NCV2RIR&location=775))
- “So I banish about ninety per cent of my worries by taking these four steps: “1. Writing down precisely what I am worrying about. “2. Writing down what I can do about it. “3. Deciding what I can do about it. “4. Starting immediately how to carry out that decision.” ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NCV2RIR&location=778))
