### Highlights

- Sound money allows people to think about the long term and to save and invest more for the future. Saving and investing for the long run are the key to capital accumulation and the advance of human civilization. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=434))
- It is not easy to accumulate enough apples to be exchanged for a car at once, because they will rot before the deal can be completed. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=486))
- A good that assumes the role of a widely accepted medium of exchange is called money. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=496))
- earlier: their salability across scales, across space, and across time. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=519))
- A good's salability across time refers to its ability to hold value into the future, allowing the holder to store wealth in it, which is the second function of money: store of value. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=524))
- For anything to function as a good store of value, it has to beat this trap: it has to appreciate when people demand it as a store of value, but its producers have to be constrained from inflating the supply significantly enough to bring the price down. ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=826))
- It is the author's opinion that the history of China and India, and their failure to catch up to the West during the twentieth century, is inextricably linked to this massive destruction of wealth and capital brought about by the demonetization of the monetary metal these countries utilized. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=1044))
- in 1968, the U.S. dollar had to start getting revalued compared to gold to acknowledge the years of inflation it had suffered. The second problem was that some countries started trying to repatriate their gold reserves from the United States as they started to recognize the diminishing purchasing power of their paper money. French president Charles de Gaulle even sent a French military carrier to New York to get his nation's gold back, but when the Germans attempted to repatriate their gold, the United States had decided it had had enough. Gold reserves were running low, and on August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon announced the end of dollar convertibility to gold, thus letting the gold price float in the market freely. In effect, the United States had defaulted on its commitment to redeem its dollars in gold. The fixed exchange rates between the world's currencies, which the IMF was tasked with maintaining, had now been let loose to be determined by the movement of goods and capital across borders and in ever‐more‐sophisticated foreign exchange markets. ([Location 1559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=1559))
- The problem with government‐provided money is that its hardness depends entirely on the ability of those in charge to not inflate its supply. Only political constraints provide hardness, and there are no physical, economic, or natural constraints on how much money government can produce. Cattle, silver, gold, and seashells all require serious effort to produce them and can never be generated in large quantities at the drop of a hat, but government money requires only the fiat of the government. The constantly increasing supply means a continuous devaluation of the currency, expropriating the wealth of the holders to benefit those who print the currency, and those who receive it earliest.19 History has shown that governments will inevitably succumb to the temptation of inflating the money supply. Whether it's because of downright graft, “national emergency,” or an infestation of inflationist schools of economics, government will always find a reason and a way to print more money, expanding government power while reducing the wealth of the currency holders. ([Location 1691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=1691))
- Sound money, then, according to Mises, is what the market freely chooses to be money, and what remains under the control of its owner, safe from coercive meddling and intervention. For as long as the money was controlled by anyone other than the owner, whoever controlled it would always face too strong an incentive to pilfer the value of the money through inflation or confiscation, and to use it as a political tool to achieve their political goals at the expanse of the holders. ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=1753))
- understanding of monetary economics afforded to us by Austrian economics, the importance of sound money can be explained for three broad reasons: first, it protects value across time, which gives people a bigger incentive to think of their future, and lowers their time preference. The lowering of the time preference is what initiates the process of human civilization and allows for humans to cooperate, prosper, and live in peace. Second, sound money allows for trade to be based on a stable unit of measurement, facilitating ever‐larger markets, free from government control and coercion, and with free trade comes peace and prosperity. Further, a unit of account is essential for all forms of economic calculation and planning, and unsound money makes economic calculation unreliable and is the root cause of economic recessions and crises. Finally, sound money is an essential requirement for individual freedom from despotism and repression, as the ability of a coercive state to create money can give it undue power over its subjects, power which by its very nature will attract the least worthy, and most immoral, to take its reins. ([Location 1863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=1863))
- Time preference refers to the ratio at which individuals value the present compared to the future. Because humans do not live eternally, death could come to us at any point in time, making the future uncertain. And because consumption is necessary for survival, people always value present consumption more than future consumption, as the lack of present consumption could make the future never arrive. In other words, time preference is positive for all humans; there is always a discount on the future compared to the present. ([Location 1873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=1873))
- While microeconomics has focused on transactions between individuals, and macroeconomics on the role of government in the economy, the reality is that the most important economic decisions to any individual's well‐being are the ones they conduct in their trade‐offs with their future self. ([Location 1942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=1942))
- The better the money is at holding its value, the more it incentivizes people to delay consumption and instead dedicate resources for production in the future, leading to capital accumulation and improvement of living standards, ([Location 1982](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=1982))

    - **Note:** If money is constantly losing value, then there is not incentive to save. This is futher exacberated by lower interest rates which govt enforces. This causes people to borrow more and spend more, make riskier investment bets to keep up the purchasing power. All this lead to short term thinking
- Had government money been a superior unit of account and store of value, it would not need government legal tender laws to enforce it, nor would governments worldwide have had to confiscate large quantities of gold and continue to hold them in their central bank reserves. The fact that central banks continue to hold onto their gold, and have even started increasing their reserves, testifies to the confidence they have in their own currencies in the long term, and in the inescapable monetary role of gold as the value of paper currencies continues to plumb new depths. ([Location 2147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=2147))

- With unsound money, on the other hand, only returns that are higher than the rate of depreciation of the currency will be positive in real terms, creating incentives for high‐return but high‐risk investment and spending. ([Location 2160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=2160))
- The reduced incentive to save is mirrored with an increased incentive to spend, and with interest rates regularly manipulated downwards and banks able to issue more credit than ever, lending stopped being restricted to investment, but has moved on to consumption. Credit cards and consumer loans allow individuals to borrow for the sake of consumption without even the pretense of performing investment in the future. ([Location 2191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=2191))
    - **Note:** borrowing money is no longer limited to use in investment. But borrowed money becomes source of livelihood. 
      Homes are borrowed, everyday groceries are borrowed on credit card. 
      This is not capitalism. This is binge consumption
- the only cause of economic growth in the first place is delayed gratification, saving, and investment, which extend the length of the production cycle and increase the productivity of the methods of production, leading to better standards of living. ([Location 2207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=2207))
- parents. Rather than witness their savings accumulate and raise the capital stock, this generation has to work to pay off the growing interest on its debt, working harder to fund entitlement programs they will barely get to enjoy while paying higher taxes and barely being able to save for their old age. ([Location 2216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=2216))
- As the central bank manages the money supply and interest rate, there will inevitably be a discrepancy between savings and loanable funds. Central banks are generally trying to spur economic growth and investment and to increase consumption, so they tend to increase the money supply and lower the interest rate, resulting in a larger quantity of loanable funds than savings. ([Location 2641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=2641))
- Economic logic clearly shows how recessions are the inevitable outcome of interest rate manipulation in the same way shortages are the inevitable outcome of price ceilings. ([Location 2672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=2672))

- If society were a little girl in that marshmallow experiment, Keynesian economics seeks to alter the experiment so that waiting would punish the girl by giving her half a marshmallow instead of two, making the entire concept of self‐control and low time preference appear counterproductive. Indulging immediate pleasures is the more likely course of action economically, and that will then reflect on culture and society at large. ([Location 3175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=3175))
- Whereas liberalism held the role of government as allowing individuals to live in liberty and enjoy the benefits, and suffer the consequences, of their actions, liberality was the radical notion that it was government's role to allow individuals to indulge in all their desires while protecting them from the consequences. Socially, economically, and politically, the role of government was recast as the wish‐granting genie, and the population merely had to vote for what it wanted to have it fulfilled. ([Location 3294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=3294))
- Bitcoin is the hardest money ever invented: growth in its value cannot possibly increase its supply; it can only make the network more secure and immune to attack. ([Location 3774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=3774))
- Gold became the prime money of every civilized society precisely because it was the hardest to produce, but Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment makes it even harder to produce. A massive increase in the price of gold will, in the long run, lead to larger quantities being produced, but no matter how high the price of bitcoins rises, the supply stays the same and the safety of the network only increases. ([Location 3780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=3780))

- It costs ever‐increasing quantities of electricity and processing power to record transactions, but the cost of verifying the validity of the transactions is close to zero and will remain at that level no matter how much Bitcoin grows. To try to commit fraudulent transactions to the Bitcoin ledger is to deliberately waste resources on solving the proof‐of‐work only to watch nodes reject it at almost no cost, thereby withholding the block reward from the miner. ([Location 3784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=3784))
- In other words, Bitcoin relies on economic incentives, making fraud far costlier than its rewards. ([Location 3809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=3809))
- The growth in the price is a reflection of the growing use and utility that the network offers its users. ([Location 4011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4011))
- Bitcoin is the cheapest way to buy the future, because Bitcoin is the only medium guaranteed to not be debased, ([Location 4311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4311))
- As Bitcoin continues to evolve in the direction of having a higher market value with higher transaction fees, it starts to look more and more like a reserve currency than a currency for everyday trading and transactions. Even at the time of writing, with Bitcoin at a relatively small level of public adoption, the majority of Bitcoin transactions are not recorded on‐chain, but occur in exchanges and various types of Bitcoin‐based online platforms such as gambling and casino websites. These businesses will credit or debit bitcoins to their customers on their own internal records and then only make transactions on the Bitcoin network when customers deposit or withdraw funds. ([Location 4463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4463))
- Bitcoin is money free of counterparty risk, and its network can offer final settlement of large‐volume payments within minutes. Bitcoin can thus be best understood to compete with settlement payments between central banks and large financial institutions, and it compares favorably to them due to its verifiable record, cryptographic security, and imperviousness to third‐party security holes. ([Location 4486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4486))
- If bitcoin continues to appreciate while a central bank doesn't own any of it, then the market value of their reserve currencies and gold will be declining in terms of Bitcoin, placing the central bank at a disadvantage the later it decides to acquire reserves. ([Location 4545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4545))
- Bitcoin can also serve as a useful reserve asset for central banks facing international restrictions on their banking operations, or unhappy at the dollar‐centric global monetary system. ([Location 4555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4555))
- Based on the foregoing analysis, the real advantage of Bitcoin lies in it being a reliable long‐term store of value, and a sovereign form of money that allows individuals to conduct permissionless transactions. Bitcoin's main uses in the foreseeable future will follow from these competitive advantages, and not from its ability to offer ubiquitous or cheap transactions. ([Location 4569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4569))

- unlike industrial demand for gold, which is completely independent of its monetary demand, demand for bitcoin to operate the network is inextricably linked to demand for it as a store of value. It thus cannot be expected to play a significant role in ameliorating the volatility of bitcoin's market value as it is growing in its monetary role. ([Location 4619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4619))
- An international settlement currency should be neutral to the monetary policy of different countries, which is why gold played this role with excellence during the international gold standard. Bitcoin would have an advantage over gold in playing this role because its settlement can be completed in minutes, and the authenticity of the transactions can be trivially verified by anyone with an Internet connection, at virtually no cost. Gold, on the other hand, takes more time to transport, and its clearance relies on varying degrees of trust in intermediaries responsible for settling it and transferring it. This might preserve gold's monetary role for in‐person cash transactions while Bitcoin specializes in international settlement. ([Location 4643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4643))
- For an attacker to try to insert fraudulent transactions into the Bitcoin ledger, he would need to have a majority of the processing power behind the network to accept his fraud. Honest nodes that are part of the network would have no incentive to do so, because it would undermine the integrity of Bitcoin and devalue the rewards they are receiving, wasting the electricity and resources they have expended on it. So an attacker's only hope would be to mobilize a quantity of processing power that constitutes more than 50% of the network to verify his fraud and build on it as if it were valid. Such a move could have been possible in the early days of Bitcoin when the total processing power behind the network was very small. But because the economic value held in the network at the time was nonexistent or insignificant, no such attacks materialized. As the network continued to grow and more members brought processing power to it, the cost to attack the network rose. ([Location 4714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4714))

- The reward to nodes for verifying transactions has proven to be a profitable use of processing power. In January 2017, the processing power behind the Bitcoin network is equivalent to that of 2 trillion consumer laptops. It is more than two million times larger than the processing power of the world's largest supercomputer, and more than 200,000 times larger than the world's top 500 supercomputers combined. By monetizing processing power directly, Bitcoin has become the largest single‐purpose computer network in the world. ([Location 4722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4722))
- In conclusion, the Bitcoin coders face a strong incentive to abide by consensus rules if they are to have their code adopted. The miners have to abide by the network consensus rules to receive compensation for the resources they spend on proof‐of‐work. The network members face a strong incentive to remain on the consensus rules to ensure they can clear their transactions on the network. Any individual coder, miner, or node operator is dispensable to the network. If they stray away from consensus rules, the most likely outcome is that they will individually waste resources. As long as the network provides positive rewards to its participants, it's likely that replacement participants will come up. The consensus parameters of Bitcoin can thus be understood as being sovereign. To the extent that Bitcoin will exist, it will exist according to these parameters and specifications. This very strong status‐quo bias in Bitcoin's operation makes alterations to its money supply schedule, or important economic parameters, extremely difficult. It is only because of this stable equilibrium that Bitcoin can be considered hard money. ([Location 4810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4810))
- Bitcoin is sovereign: it runs by its own rules, and there are no outsiders who can alter these rules. It might even be helpful to think of the parameters of Bitcoin as being similar to the rotation of the earth, sun, moon, or stars, forces outside of our control which are to be lived, not altered.

- The biggest scope for scaling Bitcoin transactions will likely come off‐chain, where many simpler technologies can be used for small and unimportant payments. This ensures there can be no compromise of Bitcoin's two most significant properties for which using extensive processing power is justified: digital sound money and digital cash. There are no alternative technologies that can offer these two functions, but there are many technologies that can offer small payments and consumer spending at low costs, and the technology for these choices is very simple to implement relatively reliably with current banking technologies. ([Location 4989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=4989))
- paying. Even at current low levels of adoption, the demand for digital cash and digital sound money has already raised transaction fees to the point where they cannot compete with centralized solutions like PayPal and credit cards for small payments. This has not stalled Bitcoin's growth, however, which indicates that the market demand for Bitcoin is driven by its use as a digital cash and digital store of value, rather than small digital payments. ([Location 5002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=5002))
- the majority of Bitcoin transactions today are already carried out off‐chain, and only settled on‐chain. Bitcoin‐based businesses, such as exchanges, casinos, or gaming websites, will only use Bitcoin's blockchain for customer deposits and withdrawals, but within their platforms, all transactions are recorded on their local databases, denominated in Bitcoin. ([Location 5024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=5024))
- In effect, Bitcoin is already being used as a reserve asset in the majority of the transactions in the Bitcoin economy. Should Bitcoin's growth continue it is only natural to see the number of off‐chain transactions increase faster than the on‐chain transactions. ([Location 5029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=5029))
- In conclusion, there are many possibilities for increasing the number of bitcoin transactions without having to alter the architecture of Bitcoin as it is, and without requiring all current node operators to upgrade simultaneously. Scaling solutions will come from node operators improving the way they send data on Bitcoin transactions to other network members. This will come through joining transactions together, off‐chain transactions, and payment channels. On‐chain scaling solutions are unlikely to be enough to meet the growing demand for Bitcoin over time, and so second‐layer solutions are likely to continue to grow in importance, leading to the emergence of a new kind of financial institution similar to today's banks, using cryptography, and operating primarily online. ([Location 5066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=5066))
- Hypothetically, if the entire world's banking and monetary systems were replaced with those of the gold standard in the late nineteenth century, where individual freedom and hard money were paramount, the demand for Bitcoin would likely subside significantly. It might just be the case that such a move would cause a large enough reduction in demand for Bitcoin that brings its price significantly down, hurting current holders significantly, increasing the volatility of the currency, and setting it back many years. With the increased volatility and the availability of a reliable and relatively stable hard‐money international monetary standard, the incentive for using Bitcoin drops significantly. In a world in which governments' restrictions and inflationary tendencies are disciplined by the gold standard, it might just be the case that gold's first‐mover advantage and relative purchasing power stability would constitute an insurmountable hurdle for Bitcoin to overcome, by depriving Bitcoin of the fast growth in users and thus preventing it from reaching a large enough size with any semblance of stability in price. ([Location 5284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=5284))
- While it is common to think that these currencies exist in competition with Bitcoin, and that one of them might overtake Bitcoin in the future, in reality they are not in competition with Bitcoin because they can never have the properties that make Bitcoin functional as digital cash and sound money. In order for a digital system to function as digital cash, it has to be outside the control of any third party; its operation needs to conform to the will of its user according to the protocol, with no possibility for any third party to stop these payments. After years of watching altcoins get created, it seems impossible that any coin will recreate the adversarial standoff that exists between Bitcoin stakeholders and prevents any party from controlling payments in it.

- Bitcoin's mechanism for establishing the authenticity and validity of the ledger is extremely complex and complicated, but it serves an explicit purpose: issuing a currency and moving value online without the need for a trusted third party. “Blockchain technology,” to the extent that such a thing exists, is not an efficient or cheap or fast way of transacting online. It is actually immensely inefficient and slow compared to centralized solutions. The only advantage that it offers is eliminating the need to trust in third‐party intermediation. The only possible uses of this technology are in avenues where removing third‐party intermediation is of such paramount value to end users that it justifies the increased cost and lost efficiency. And the only process for which it actually can succeed in eliminating third‐party intermediation is the process of moving the native token of the network itself, as the code of the ([Location 5452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=5452))
- Trustless digital cash has so far been the only successful implementation for blockchain technology precisely because it is a clean and simple technological process to operate, leading to its ledger growing relatively slowly over time. This means that being a member of the Bitcoin network is possible for a residential computer and connection in most of the ([Location 5494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=5494))
- Once one understands the mechanism of Bitcoin's operation, it is clear that there is a trade‐off involved in moving to a system that does not rely on any trusted third parties. The advantages lie in individual sovereignty over the protocol, censorship‐resistance, and immutability of the money supply growth and technical parameters. The disadvantages lie in the need for much larger processing power expenditure to perform the same amount of work. There is no reason, outside of naïve futuristic hype, to believe that this is a trade‐off that is worthwhile for much. It may well be that the only place where this trade‐off is worthwhile is the managing of a global homogeneous supranational sound money, ([Location 5521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07BPM3GZQ&location=5521))
