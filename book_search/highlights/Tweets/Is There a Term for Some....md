### Highlights

- Is there a term for someone who geeks out on how to get to know someone better? Because I'm definitely in that club. 
  So of course I looooove thinking about interview questions.
  Thread of my favorite questions to ask folks to understand how they think and work.

- For understanding their motivation:

- I always remind myself that spending an hour with someone gives me a *tiny* slice of who they are. So trusted references count for way more than an interview. 
  Biases, time spent on reflection, communication skills, etc all sway our understanding of others. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1392504875414528002))
- Still, we can make the time we do have higher-signal with a curious mindset and a better set of questions.
