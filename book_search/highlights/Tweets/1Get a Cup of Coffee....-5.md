  Get a cup of coffee.
  In this thread, I'll show you how to read and understand a company's Balance Sheet.
  As investors, we should be able to judge businesses by looking at their financial statements.
  And the Balance Sheet, of course, is 1 of 3 key financial statements:

  Imagine that Alice and Bob are neighbors.
  Alice owns and operates a "candles" business.
  She makes candles in her loft, which she's converted into a lab of sorts.
  She then takes the candles to a local home goods store, which sells them and pays her at the end of each month. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069148965081089))

  Suppose it costs Alice $10 to make a candle. This is the cost of the candle's glass case, wax, wick, etc.
  And suppose the home goods store pays Alice $15/candle, and sells 1460 of her candles every month.
  Then, Alice would make ~$87.6K/year. Here's her Income Statement:

  Let's now turn to Bob, Alice's neighbor.
  Bob owns and runs a "burrito" business.
  Each morning, he makes 120 burritos. He takes these burritos to a busy street corner at lunch time, and sells them.
  On the way back home, he buys groceries to make the next day's burritos. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069158079262721))

  Suppose it costs Bob $4 to make a burrito. This is the cost of the tortilla, the rice, the beans, etc.
  And suppose Bob sells his burritos for $6 apiece.
  Then, Bob would also make $87.6K/year.
  Here's *his* Income Statement:

  Of course, these models are *highly* simplified.
  Both Alice and Bob probably have several other costs -- insurance, permits, taxes, etc.
  But to learn key concepts, it's useful to study such "bare bones" examples -- stripped of all extraneous details.
  So, stick with me! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069166845415427))

  Here's a question.
  Whose business is "better": Alice's or Bob's?
  As we've seen above, both businesses have *exactly* the same annual Revenues ($262.8K), Costs ($175.2K), Profits ($87.6K), and Margins (~33.33%).
  So, economically speaking, aren't these businesses identical? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069169143836673))
- 8/
  The answer is NO.
  Why?
  Because, even though these businesses produce identical *earnings* for their owners each year, they require different amounts of *capital* to do so.
  That is, these businesses have identical Income Statements. But very different *Balance Sheets*. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069171400437765))
- 9/
  For example, Alice's business requires her to invest $10/candle * 1460 candles = $14.6K of capital into it at the outset.
  Once she *puts in* this $14.6K to make her candles, she gets to *take out* $7.3K/month ($87.6K/year) from the business ($5 profit/candle * 1460 candles). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069173690519555))
- 10/
  What about Bob?
  Well, following the same logic, Bob only needs to *put in* $480 of capital ($4/burrito * 120 burritos).
  And once he does that, he gets to *take out* $240 *daily* ($2 profit/burrito * 120 burritos) -- which adds up to $87.6K over a year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069176148377602))
- 11/
  Clearly, Bob's is the "better" business.
  First, it requires *less* capital ($480 vs Alice's $14.6K) to produce the *same* annual earnings ($87.6K).
  Second, it *turns* this capital *daily* vs Alice's *monthly* -- allowing Bob to take out $240/day vs Alice's $7.3K/month. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069178614620160))
- 12/
  That's why it's important to study ALL the financial statements of a business -- not just its Income Statement.
  In particular, studying the *Assets* side of the *Balance Sheet* tells us how much capital a business needs to conduct its operations. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069181001199617))
- 13/
  Here's the *Assets* side of Alice's balance sheet, as her business cycles through various states.
  As we can see, the Assets on this Balance Sheet NEVER drop below $14.6K -- the *minimum* amount of capital this business needs to function. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FK2byarVUAAfC9n.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069187141660672))
- 14/
  Compare that to the Assets on Bob's Balance Sheet, and we immediately see that Bob's business requires only $480 to function -- very modest compared to Alice's $14.6K.
  High quality businesses require only a small amount of *assets* per dollar of *earnings* produced.

  Alice's and Bob's businesses are both "simple". They only need "working capital" assets -- cash, receivables, and inventory.
  In addition to these, real world businesses typically also need fixed assets (eg, property, plant, and equipment), goodwill, intangibles, etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069197811970050))
- 16/
  For example, here are the Assets listed on Home Depot's and Starbucks's Balance Sheets (which I took from their latest 10-Qs).
  These Asset sections have more line items. But the fundamental principles are still the same as Alice's and Bob's simple businesses.

  So, that's the *Assets* side of the Balance Sheet. It tells us how much capital a business needs (and has) to function.
  Every Balance Sheet also has a *Liabilities* side. This tells us *where* all this capital in the business *comes from*. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069207593062400))
- 18/
  There are 3 main "sources" of capital in a business: Equity, Debt, and Float.
  Equity is capital *put up* by the business's owners.
  Debt is capital *borrowed* by the business -- on which it typically pays interest. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069209895686145))
- 19/
  And Float is capital that various parties (eg, suppliers, customers, employees, the government, etc.) have provided to the business -- typically for free.
  For example, a supplier may sell raw materials to the business on credit. A customer may pre-pay for an order. Etc.

- 20/
  So, that's what the Liabilities side of the Balance Sheet does. It breaks down the capital in the business by *source* -- into Equity, Debt, and Float.
  For example, here's how the Liabilities listed on Home Depot's and Starbucks's Balance Sheets break down:

  And because the *Assets* and the *Liabilities* sides of the Balance Sheet are just two different ways of slicing and dicing the *same* capital, they both have to add up to the same total.
  In other words, the Balance Sheet has to "balance". Duh!

- 22/
  So, why should we study the Liabilities side?
  After all, $1 of capital is $1 of capital, right? Why do we care whether it's Equity, Debt, or Float?
  The answer is: businesses can boost returns for their owners by deploying someone else's capital for the owners' benefit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069238819667970))
- 23/
  For example, suppose Alice made a deal with her suppliers that she'd pay them *after* she herself got paid by the home goods store.
  Then, she wouldn't need to put up $14.6K of her own money. She could put up $0, and still take out $87.6K per year! 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FK29j-rVEAQAxUu.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069248529494018))
- 24/
  That's the power of Float.
  It's essentially *free money* that can transform ordinary businesses into extraordinary ones.
  No wonder Warren Buffett is such a big fan!
  From his 2009 letter: 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FK3AOi2VgAE773k.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1490069256725155842))
- 25/
  And it's not just Float that provides this kind of "leverage".
  The other non-Equity source of capital -- Debt -- can do so too. But Debt can also increase risk and make a business fragile -- usually to a larger extent than Float.

  The Balance Sheet is such a key statement. I hope this thread showed you both *why* and *how* to read one. 
  If you're still with me, thank you very much! You're an Asset to my Twitter experience, and for that I'm in your Debt.
