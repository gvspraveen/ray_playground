- 1. High-Intensity Exercise
  Every time you work out, you are training your heart to be stronger and more efficient at pumping blood throughout the body.

- 3. Stay Hydrated
  Dehydration can cause the blood to thicken, which means your heart has to work even harder to push the blood around to the rest of your body.
  Drink plenty of water to give your heart a break and lower resting heart rate. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/m_franceschetti/status/1409331321604907014))
