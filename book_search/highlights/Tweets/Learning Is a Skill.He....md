### Highlights

- Learning is a skill.
  Here's a tactical approach to learning anything: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586204961677313))
- Ok, so you've been bit by the curiosity bug.
  Now what?
  Years of school didn't really prepare you for this. The "old way" of researching and learning is dead.
  We need a "new way"—tailored to our new, digital reality.
  This thread shares my framework for learning anything. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586205775372290))
- The learning framework involves six steps:
  (1) Identify & Establish
  (2) Research
  (3) Skin in the Game
  (4) Engage Community
  (5) Teach
  (6) Reflect & Review
  The general structure is fixed, but its application is intended to be dynamic & iterative.
  Let's walk through the steps... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586206681346049))
- Identify & Establish
  Identify the topic and write down everything you know about it.
  Put the topic at the top of the page and drop in the extent of your current knowledge below it.
  I use Notion—I like being able to pull in other links and resources—but anything works. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586207713140739))
- Research
  This is where the fun begins.
  The most effective strategy for research: start horizontal, then go vertical.
  Horizontal = Breadth
  Vertical = Depth
  I'll elaborate: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586209751576579))
- When you start horizontal, you gather information across the full breadth of the topic.
  This gives you the capacity to "see the entire field”—it draws a surface-level map of the topic.
  With horizontal research, keep it simple: Google and Wikipedia (gasp!) are both great tools. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586210695327747))
- Use your note-taking workspace to document the horizontal information.
  Note the underlying sources that provided the horizontal information (i.e. look at the Wikipedia footnotes), which come in handy as guideposts to focus your journey when you go vertical. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586211588608001))
- Vertical research was historically much more challenging—hours of finding and reading long, dense books on a topic.
  But in the Information Age, we have a diverse array of tools that provide much higher time leverage.
  Reddit
  Twitter
  Newsletters
  Podcasts
  Expert Networks
  Books ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586212536594437))
- A few notes on how to use each (which I will expand on in my newsletter):
  Reddit: Search your topic, find subreddits and threads, read the commentary, click through to the links.
  Twitter: Find the authority figures, read their writing or comments; DM them if you want more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586213555843073))
- Newsletters: Thought leaders on the topic are writing one, so read it. Also read what they are consuming (I use Faves for this).
  Podcasts: Focus on primary sources (discussions with founders, leaders, etc.); listen on 1.25x or 1.5x speed to cut through. https://t.co/a9VwsrCzwH ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586214587535361))
- Skin in the Game
  If you want to accelerate your learning curve, put some skin in the game.
  Skin in the game raises the stakes of your learning. It is a behavioral trick to build deeper incentives.
  "Skin" can be literal (money) or metaphorical (personal public commitment). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586216936419334))
- Want to learn more about a specific company? Buy a few shares of the stock.
  Want to learn about Web 3.0? Buy an NFT, post it as your photo, join the Discord community.
  Want to write an article on X? Commit to it publicly (I do this all the time to force myself to write!). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586218232455169))
- Engage Community
  Learning is communal, not individual.
  Engage with the community to accelerate learning.
  As anyone who has ever learned a new language knows—immersion is an incredibly powerful force.
  Two pieces of tactical advice:
  (1) Talk to authorities
  (2) Phone friends ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586220241559555))
- Find a few authorities on the topic—DM, email, call them, ask questions.
  Call 3-5 friends and talk about what you are learning. They will ask questions that expose holes in your knowledge and point out opinions that will force you to think more deeply.
  Community is the key. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586221214609412))
- Teach
  If you want to learn, teach.
  The @ProfFeynman Technique:
  Use simple language (no jargon or acronyms!) to explain what you've learned to a few people.
  If you can't explain it to a 5-year-old, you probably don't understand it well enough (yet). https://t.co/OoieG44ZV6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1431586222204391428))
- To recap, my framework for learning anything:
  (1) Identify & Establish
  (2) Research
  (3) Skin in the Game
  (4) Engage Community
  (5) Teach
  (6) Reflect & Review
