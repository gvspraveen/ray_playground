### Highlights

- If you want to improve your writing, start by becoming a better note-taker.
  Here are 10 ways to do that:
  1. Save only the best notes: Don't hoard information. Save your top 5-10% of ideas only. That way, you can trust that everything in your note-taking system is high-quality. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1244089929258250240))

- 2. Create evergreen notes.
  Like a good investment, the benefits of your note-taking system should compound in value. Save ideas that will stay relevant for many years. Read the classics, skip the news. Note-by-note, brick-by-brick you’ll build an intellectual Coliseum.

- 3. Publish regularly.
  Writing more is the fastest way to improve your note-taking system. Without the pressure to produce, your system will become messy. The pressure to produce will turn your note-taking system into an extension of your mind.

- 4. Be Lazy. 
  Your note-taking system doesn’t have to be perfect. There is only one way to measure the value of a note-taking system: how much does it help you produce? Lower your standards for note-taking, so you can raise your standards for creation.
- 5. Research happens in the background.
  In school, we’re taught to research before we write. Do the opposite. Compile notes over time. Then, once you have an idea, start writing immediately — right when you have an epiphany. Start researching after you've written a draft.

- 6. Link notes together.
  Organize your ideas by topic, not by source. As you browse your note-taking system, consider the serendipity you want to create for your future self. For example, if you read two books about a topic, link those notes together.

- 7. Note-taking is a form of time-travel.
  You don’t just take notes to remember ideas. You also take notes to remember experiences. Reading your notes takes you back to a different state of consciousness. Note-taking is a rebellion against the entropy of memory. https://t.co/gTl0bQnK2c
- 8. The ultimate goal of note-taking is to improve your ideas.
  Too many people treat note-taking as an end in itself. But the goal of note-taking isn’t to save information. It’s to have ideas you wouldn’t have had otherwise. To be smarter, faster, and more creative.
- 9. Practice Instant Outlines. 
  Build a strong foundation for your note-taking system and start collecting notes. Soon, you’ll be able to outline an essay in less than 30 minutes. Here’s what my outlining process looks like.

- 10. Keep things messy.
  Your note-taking system should encourage serendipity. If the divisions inside your system are too clean, you can’t make unexpected connections between ideas — which is the ultimate goal of a note-taking system. Ditch perfection. Embrace randomness.
- If you're interested in these ideas, I just published a series of short podcasts with @fortelabs — the king of note-taking.
  We talked about intermediate packets, writing from abundance, and why you should keep your ideas moving.
