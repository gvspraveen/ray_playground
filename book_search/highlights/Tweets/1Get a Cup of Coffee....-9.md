### Highlights

- 1/
  Get a cup of coffee.
  In this thread, I'll walk you through 2 key portfolio diversification principles:
  (i) Minimizing correlations, and
  (ii) Re-balancing intelligently.
  You don't need Markowitz's portfolio theory or the Kelly Criterion to understand these concepts.

  Imagine we have a stock: ABC Inc. Ticker: $ABC.
  The good thing about ABC is: in 4 out of 5 years (ie, with probability 80%), the stock goes UP 30%.
  But the *rest* of the time -- ie, with probability 20%, or in 1 out of 5 years -- the stock goes DOWN 50%. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239110184583168))
- 3/
  We have no way to predict in advance which years will be good and which will be bad.
  So, let's say we just buy and hold ABC stock for a long time -- like 25 years.
  The question is: what return are we most likely to get from ABC over these 25 years? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239112399175680))
- 4/
  We know ABC stock goes UP 80% of the time and DOWN the other 20%.
  So, the most likely scenario is:
  During our 25 year holding period, we'll get 20 UP years and 5 DOWN years.
  This gets us an annualized return of ~7.39%. Each $1 we put in becomes ~$5.94.
  Calculations:

  Now let's bring in a second stock: XYZ Inc. Ticker: $XYZ.
  Suppose $XYZ exhibits exactly the same statistical characteristics as $ABC.
  That is, $XYZ also goes UP 30% in 4 out of 5 years and DOWN 50% in 1 out of 5 years.
  But $XYZ and $ABC don't necessarily move *together*. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239120045391872))
- 6/
  In some years, *both* $ABC and $XYZ go UP.
  In other years, they *both* go DOWN.
  And in still other years, they move in *opposite* directions. That is, *one of them* goes UP and the *other* goes DOWN. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239122159308801))
- 7/
  The more often these stocks move *together* -- ie, *both* UP or *both* DOWN -- the more *positively correlated* we say they are.
  And why do we care?
  Because the MORE positively correlated our stocks are, the LESS benefit we'll get from diversification. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239124004732928))
- 8/
  Suppose our stocks *both* go UP together X% of the time.
  Thus, higher X means higher correlation.
  Simple probability math now tells us:
  (i) Our stocks will go DOWN together (X - 60)% of the time, and
  (ii) They'll move in opposite directions (160 - 2*X)% of the time.

- 9/
  Also, the probabilities in our 2x2 diagram above cannot be negative.
  That is, neither (80 - X)% nor (X - 60)% can be negative.
  That means X has to lie between 60% and 80%. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239132397535232))
- 10/
  At X = 60%, our stocks are as *negatively* correlated as they can be.
  And as we raise X from 60% to 80%, their correlation turns strongly *positive*.
  The crossover from negative to positive occurs at X = 64%. At that point, there's *zero* correlation between our stocks.

  The central idea behind diversification is: everything shouldn't blow up *at the same time*.
  In other words, we *don't* want our stocks all moving *together*.
  That's why *negative* correlations are "good" and *positive* correlations are "bad". ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239139574071297))
- 12/
  But to REALLY take advantage of negative correlations, we need another key idea: intelligent re-balancing.
  Let's run some numbers to see why.
  Suppose X = 60%. That is, $ABC and $XYZ are as negatively correlated as possible. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239141495054336))
- 13/
  Now, suppose we build a 50/50 diversified portfolio of $ABC and $XYZ.
  We'll hold this portfolio for 25 years.
  But we'll never re-balance. We'll just let each individual stock ride.
  What will our most likely 25-year return be? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239143311155201))
- 14/
  Well, if we never re-balance, each stock is just going to do its thing individually.
  Each is likely to give us 20 UP years and 5 DOWN years -- though not in the same order.
  This will let us turn $1 into ~$5.94 -- the same ~7.39% annualized return we had before. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FfwW1Z6VEAEB4CE.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239147975266304))
- 15/
  Thus, the *negative* correlation between $ABC and $XYZ does NOT help us if we don't re-balance.
  Whether we own:
  - Just $ABC,
  - Or just $XYZ,
  - Or a 50/50 "$ABC plus $XYZ" combo,
  we're likely to end up at the exact same place -- earning ~7.39% per year. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239151209058307))
- 16/
  What happens if we *do* re-balance our portfolio periodically -- say, every year?
  For example, if $ABC goes UP and $XYZ goes DOWN during a year, we sell a bit of $ABC at the end of the year and use the money to buy a bit of $XYZ -- so our portfolio is again back at 50/50. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239153096466432))
- 17/
  With this re-balancing strategy in place, here are all the outcomes that can possibly happen during any given year -- along with their respective probabilities: 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ffwt2iTVUAAbGXf.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239159148892160))
- 18/
  For example, with X = 60% -- our strongest possible negative correlation -- our portfolio:
  - Goes UP 30% in 3 out of 5 years, and
  - Goes down 10% in 2 out of 5 years.
  Over 25 years, our most likely outcome turns $1 into ~$17.85.
  That's ~12.22% annualized.
  Calculations: 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ffw1EH9UAAEirzp.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239165998178304))
- 19/
  So, when X = 60% (ie, strongly negative correlation), we have:
  *Without* re-balancing: $1 --> ~$5.94, and
  *With* re-balancing: $1 --> ~$17.85 (>3x as much!),
  over the same 25 years.
  Thus, negative correlations + re-balancing can be a powerful combination. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239168732864513))
- 20/
  If we do this well, our *portfolio* can end up getting us a HIGHER return than any single stock in it!
  We just saw an example with 2 stocks. Each got us only ~7.39%. But a 50/50 re-balanced portfolio of them got us ~12.22%.
  When I first saw this, I couldn't believe it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239170532216832))
- 21/
  This is the ESSENCE of diversification.
  - We minimize correlations, so our portfolio nearly always has *both* risen and fallen stocks, and
  - We "cash in" on this gap via re-balancing -- ie, we periodically sell over-valued stocks and put the money into under-valued ones. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1584239172381945857))

  Also, negative correlations aren't strictly necessary.
  We could use stocks with zero -- or even positive -- correlation.
  But the MORE heavily correlated our stocks, the LESS "bang for the buck" we get from re-balancing.
  Like so:

- 23/
  As investors, we spend a lot of time analyzing individual stocks.
  But we tend to focus less on *portfolio* construction: do our stocks fit well together? Are we re-balancing sensibly? Etc.
  I hope this thread shed some light on these topics.
  Happy Diwali folks!
