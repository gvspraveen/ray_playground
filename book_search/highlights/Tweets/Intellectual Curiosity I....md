- Scrub Your Windows
  “Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in.” - Isaac Asimov
  Curiosity is a light that can only enter when your mental windows are clean.
  Scrub them off now and then.
  Let the light in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1393558624560041984))
- Embrace “I Don’t Know”
  “The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.” - Socrates
  Avoid false confidence (and the people that display it!).
  Embracing what you do not know is a superpower.
  Recognize your gaps and blind spots.
  Slowly, methodically fill them in. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1393558625369526277))
- Go Down Rabbit Holes
  When you find a spark of curiosity, dive in and don’t look back.
  You cannot control when they come, so you must embrace them when they do.
  The rabbit hole is the amusement park of the intellectually curious mind.
  Enjoy it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1393558626673913857))

- Ask “Dumb” Questions
  When we are young, we always ask “Why?”
  But overtime, we develop a fear of asking the “dumb” question that may draw the ire of our peers.
  That fear stifles our intellectual curiosity.
  Fight it back. Face it.
  When in doubt, ask. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1393558627969994759))
- Build Curiosity Circles
  Curiosity is communal.
  Find a group of friends who are motivated by learning and growth. Share ideas, learnings, and insights with each other.
  You’ll build bonds and have a constant source of stimulation for your intellectual curiosity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1393558628838219783))
- Make Learning the Goal
  Learning with a specific end goal in mind often becomes a chore - it is a fast track to stifled curiosity.
  Focus on the learning itself - not other outcomes.
  Take pride in learning something new every single day.

- Open Up to the World
  The diversity of human experience in our world is one of the greatest gifts to the intellectually curious mind.
  When you meet someone new, take genuine interest in their life and experiences.
  The world opens up to you, when you open up to the world. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1393558630557908992))

- Focus on Your Passions
  Forced learning is for school. It doesn’t work in practice.
  It stifles curiosity.
  Find what you truly enjoy learning about. It doesn’t matter what it is. It doesn’t have to be “intellectual” or impressive.
  Remember: You are learning for you! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1393558631350640644))

- Read Flexibly
  Books are a life changing investment that you can make for under $100.
  But to take advantage, you must read flexibly.
  Read what you love. Read what draws you in.
  When it stops doing so, put it down.
  Forced reading is the antidote to curiosity. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1393558632197877767))
