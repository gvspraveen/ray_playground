### Highlights

- One way to look at lenders is that they need some advantage in at least one of the following areas:
  Distribution—how they find borrowers. This, as I’ve mentioned many times, is effectively what sets the ceiling on most alternative lending companies’ growth. They reach a point where they tap out their existing growth channels, and either can’t afford to market to new customers or can only make the economics work by relaxing their underwriting standards.
  Data—how they select borrowers, and size loans. Fintech companies want to compete on data, because they’re usually founded by people who prefer coding to cold-calling.
  Funding—how they get the capital for loans. Bank deposits are very sticky funding, but since depositors treat them as money, banks are regulated to make them money-good. Wholesale funding is much more scalable; instead of raising funds one bank branch at a time, you borrow from larger entities. But the fact that they’re scalable on the way up makes them scalable on the way down; a bank run on wholesale funding can happen literally overnight.
  Ways to capture upside: some financial institutions get upside through strategic loans (e.g. GE lending to customers, or a credit card issuer using credit to consumers as a way to earn transaction revenue from merchants). Policy banks are another version of this: they capture upside by maintaining their influence with the government, which gets them preferential access to capital. Fannie and Freddie are, at one level, the US’s version of policy banks, with all the upsides and downsides this implies. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1384480671/15408931))
