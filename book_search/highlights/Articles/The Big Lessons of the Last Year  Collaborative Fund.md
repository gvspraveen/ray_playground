### Highlights

- A virus transferred from animal to human (has happened forever) and those humans interacted with other people (of course). It was a mystery for a while (understandable) and bad news was likely suppressed (political incentives, don’t yell fire in a theater). Other countries thought it would be contained (exceptionalism, standard denial) and didn’t act fast enough (bureaucracy, lack of leadership). We weren’t prepared (common over-optimism) and the reaction to masks and lockdowns became heated (of course) so as to become sporadic (diversity, same as ever). Feelings turned tribal (standard during an election year) and a rush to move on led to premature reopenings (standard denial, the inevitability of different people experiencing different realities).
  Each of those events on their own seems obvious, even common. But when you multiply them together you get something surprising, even unprecedented.
  Big risks are always like that, which makes them too easy to underestimate. How starkly we have been reminded over the last year. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1401237500/16013911))
