### Highlights

- Your aerobic fitness is arguably the single most important metric defining your risk of disease, your fitness, your energy, and your longevity, yet so many people have little to no understanding of how to quantify this key measure.

- Mitochondria are tiny power generating units inside our cells that convert food and oxygen into energy molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). To keep things simple here, if you are a car, the mitochondria collectively are your engines. A quantitative reduction in your mitochondria means you have fewer numbers of mitochondrial engines, while a qualitative impairment means the actual engines are damaged and cannot adequately produce sufficient ATP energy output.
  Damaged mitochondria are not just insufficient energy generators. They also generate environmental pollutants called free radicals which can cause further damage and increase the risk of common health conditions like cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Again, the car engine analogy works perfectly here. If you don’t take care of your car (body), the damaged engine (mitochondria) will compromise performance and produce pollutants (free radicals).

- VO2 max refers to the maximum volume of oxygen an individual consumes and utilizes during exercise. It’s not just how much oxygen you breathe in through your mouth, but also how much is removed from your blood to enter the mitochondria in your cells to help fuel the conversion of nutrients into energy.

- a human being with a greater VO2 max also has greater capacity to consume and utilize more oxygen (and carbon) fuel during exercise so she can run further and faster.
  Other than the ability to increase your ability to exercise longer and harder, VO2 max is an important marker for longevity and disease risk. My clinical work is focused on preventing and reversing insulin resistance, the root cause of most cases of diabetes, obesity, heart disease and many other chronic health conditions. There is a strong correlation between VO2 max and insulin resistance. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1377106585/15137464))

- let’s use the hybrid analogy. I am a hybrid vehicle and would prefer to use electric (fat) energy over gas (glucose) energy, because burning fat energy means losing more body fat and having the ability to exercise longer.
  During lower intensity exercise like the casual warm-up walk in the image above, I am almost exclusively in electric fat burning mode, but the amount of fat I’m burning is not great because my intensity (marked by heart rate) is within the lower end of the fat-burning aerobic zone. As my exercise intensity and heart rate go up, I will continue burning mostly fat until I exceed my aerobic capacity and then switch over to anaerobic metabolism. That point is often called the Crossover Point (COP) or Aerobic Threshold (AT). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1377106585/15137566))

    - **Note:** benefits of aerobic vs anaerobic exercise
- simpler and more elegant way to estimate your maximum aerobic heart rate which is 180 minus your age.
  So for our 40-year-old, that would be 140 and for individuals who are fit and don’t have significant underlying health issues, you can add 5 points. That would mean 145 for this individual which is pretty darn close to the other calculation we did ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1377106585/15137618))

- In order to assess your aerobic fitness levels, the 3 key metrics you need to measure are the following:
  1. Distance: How far are you walking, running, cycling, rowing, etc.?
  2. Time: How long did it take you to cover a given distance? For example, it took you 10 minutes to jog 1 mile.
  3. Heart Rate: Your heart rate is a measure of your exercise effort and also marks the transition zone we discussed earlier where you go from burning predominantly fat (aerobic exercise) to predominantly glucose (anaerobic exercise).

- Staying physically active during childhood helps build the mitochondrial horsepower and energy needed to keep kids healthy now and later as adults. Children with better aerobic fitness have an easier time stepping back into running or other aerobic activities later in life ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1377106585/15137724))

- Optimal mitochondrial function is a direct indicator and predictor of optimal health and energy production
  Aerobic function is a critical marker of mitochondrial function and disease risk. Far more important in my opinion than any other single metric like glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
  You need to quantify your baseline aerobic status and then monitor it over time. Options include VO2 max testing or fitness testing which combines measurable numbers like distance, time, and heart rate.
  Prioritize physical fitness in children and track their aerobic performance.
  You cannot live an optimal life through diet alone. Fasting longer or lowering carbohydrate or caloric intake further can backfire and compromise health. Once you have nutrition dialed in, shift your focus to exercise, with an emphasis on improving your aerobic fitness. Exercise is a far greater stimulus to upgrading your mitochondria than any food, supplement, or medication. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1377106585/15137758))

- At a certain point the rate of oxygen you consume actually plateaus even though your exercise intensity and thus your heart rate continues to increase. This plateau point is your VO2 max.
  Now as I continue to exercise harder and faster beyond my VO2 max, where does my energy come from? It comes from anaerobic (aka “without oxygen”) metabolism with a process called glycolysis, which relies on glucose, not oxygen, as the primary fuel source to produce ATP energy. This anaerobic metabolism does not take place in the mitochondria, but instead in a region of the cell called the cytoplasm ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1377106585/17256464))
