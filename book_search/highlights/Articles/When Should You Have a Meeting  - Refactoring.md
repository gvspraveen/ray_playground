### Highlights

- Meetings are incredible tools, we should just use them sparingly.
  A good rule of thumb for when to use a meeting is to follow the CUP rule. Use meetings for:
  Complex matters â€” e.g. a design session where several people need to converge on a solution.
  Urgent matters â€” anything where you need to act really quick, like incidents.
  Personal matters â€” anything where emotional connection matters, like 1:1s or team building moments. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1415852282/16521145))
