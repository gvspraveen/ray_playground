### Highlights

- At its core, an entertainment business does only three things:
  Create/tell stories
  Build love for those stories
  Monetize that love ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410637433/16327308))

- “Businesses based around storytelling franchises excel based on an intangible sort of operating leverage. Because it doesn’t actually ‘cost more’ to make someone ‘love your content more’, but the ‘value of this love’ is substantial, companies like Disney benefit from enormous “returns to marginal affinity”.

- It should be clear at this point that I think the most important thing in entertainment is the ability to build love. Anyone can tell a story, fewer, but still many, can tell a story well. And when stories are told, they typically generate revenue. However, profits, and especially great profits, come from love. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1410637433/16327779))

    - **Note:** disney's long term moat is the intagible love that audience have for its brand & franchises.
- Disney+ offers important comparatives advantages to this “easy money”. By bringing all of its franchises and titles together into a single platform, Disney can better tell its stories and build love. Imagine how much harder it would be to build out the Star Wars and Marvel Cinematic Universe if their interconnected series and films were split across multiple streaming services, each with their own release schedule. And even if “everything Star Wars” was sold to Amazon, Prime Video isn’t made for “Star Wars”, nor Disney. In addition, Disney+ is the one place where Disney knows each of its customers, which specific titles and heroes they like most, and helps the company to understand what else they buy across its ecosystem (totes, vacations, toys). In time, Disney+ will come to offer all of these other products, from comics to resort passes, too. All of this helps Disney improve love monetization.
