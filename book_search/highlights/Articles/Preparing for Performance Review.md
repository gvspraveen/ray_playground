### Highlights

- What’s the biggest mistake you can make? Debating or arguing the review or perf outcomes. Pragmatically, there is no upside in doing so. It ain’t changing. All you will do is come across as defensive and non-self-aware. But the real damage is that you’re straining the relationship with the person whom you most need to enlist as a partner in your career development. Resist the temptation to “defend yourself” because by doing so, you’re actually doing the exact opposite.

- Put 60% emphasis on your Strengths. In particular, figuring out what you can do to further leverage them. Leveraging strengths is much easier than fixing weaknesses, and usually much more impactful. Sometimes leveraging your strengths means finding the right job match. Sometimes it means building a team with diverse skills so that you can focus on what you’re best at and delegate what you’re not. Sometimes it means finding clever ways to let your strengths compensate for your weaknesses.
  Put 40% of your emphasis on addressing your weaknesses. But not all of them. You’re unlikely to be successful trying to tackle everything at once. Pick the one or two things you think are most important. And then write out a tactical plan with action items and milestones. Hold yourself accountable for following through. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1382384001/15332534))
