### Highlights

- While many people are familiar with Moore’s Law, far fewer have heard of Bell’s Law. Roughly put, if computer speeds double every 2 years, then every decade computers will be 32x more powerful. A 10x improvement indicates a paradigm shift, and so in 1972 Gordon Bell at DEC predicted that, every 10 years, there would be a new computing paradigm. A 32x improvement is roughly the increment after which some specific task goes from barely possible to completely trivial, at which point it’s time to build something that’s newly barely possible. The result is a new kind of computing platform that also introduces a host of new capabilities and contexts. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1397398111/15881576))
