  High income-high cost is the life a lot of people working in white-collar jobs live. We enhance our lifestyle with every increase in income, without much consideration to calling it ‘enough’ and creating greater surpluses as incomes rise.

  2. We all only have so much internal discipline, a consequence of limited mental bandwidth. Don’t fritter it away on things that don’t matter very much.
  3. Spending should always be a function of what you can afford, not a slavish devotion to some puritan ideal.
  4. Money can bring security, comfort and happiness, but beyond a certain point returns on having more of it diminish rapidly.
  5. Experiences tend to beat material goods in terms of money well spent.
  First, the big things: Your education, your career choice, your work ethic, who you marry, who you work with, your skill set, your compensation, your health, your outlook, how you think about the world and the commitment you make to yourself about continually learning and improving. Get those right, and those $5 lattes become pretty irrelevant. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1374794564/15044943))
