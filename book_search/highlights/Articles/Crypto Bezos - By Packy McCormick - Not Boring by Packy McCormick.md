### Highlights

- 1. When you find a nascent but fast-growing space, dive in. Bezos had a high-paying job at quantitative hedge fund DE Shaw, but when he saw how fast internet usage was growing, he gave it up to start from scratch. It was a good bet. 
  2. Don’t be a purist. Most consumers don’t care whether your product is on the internet, web3, or offline. Those are tools, not value propositions.  
  3. Build something that literally can’t be built within the previous paradigm. “If you can do things using a more traditional method, you probably should do things using a more traditional method.” Bezos wouldn’t build a crypto project just to build a crypto project; he’d only build on the blockchain if it let him do something for customers that he literally couldn’t do otherwise. 
  4. Attention is a scarce commodity. Bezos told Higgins that attention was “the scarce commodity of the late 20th century.” It’s still the scarce commodity today, so his advice stands: “One of the ways that you can do that [capture attention] and it’s the way that we did it is by doing something new and innovative for the first time that actually has real value for the customer.”
  5. Focus obsessively on customer experience. If you’ve read anything about Amazon, you know this one. I won’t belabor the point. But keep it in mind: it’s not about the tech, it’s about what the tech can do for customers. 
  6. Optimism for the future. “What’s really incredible about this is that this is Day One. This is the Kitty Hawk stage of electronic commerce. The late 20th Century is just a great time to be alive.” Realizing that he was at the very beginning and taking a long-term view let Bezos make smart strategic decisions, like selling books despite the smaller market size, so that he was prepared to expand as the market grew.
