### Highlights

- Beyond the product philosophy, there are some specific similarities between the two:
  Turing Completeness. If something is Turing complete, it means that it can solve any reasonable computational problem. With the introduction of Lambda, which lets users create their own formulas, Excel became Turing complete. With Ethereum, you can write smart contracts that can solve any reasonable problem.
  Composability. In Excel, “You can chain functions, passing the output of one function as the input to another, allowing for an enormous number of potential computational pipelines. Each time Excel adds a function, the power and flexibility of Excel is multiplied, since that new function can be chained to a large number of existing functions.” This is very similar to the idea of composability, or “X Legos,” on Ethereum.

- there are three asset superclasses:
  Capital Assets are productive and generate value or cash-flow. Examples include equities, bonds, or rentable real estate.
  Transformable/Consumable Assets can be consumed one time, transformed into another asset, and their consumption produces economic yield. Think energy or commodities.
  Store-of-Value Assets are scarce, cannot be consumed, just transferred, and their value persists over time and space. Examples include gold, currencies, art, or bitcoin.
  Hoffman argues that Ether, as Turing complete programmable money, can be all three once ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414622886/16481094))

- the bull case for Ethereum is that simple if you believe a few things.
  Web3 will continue to grow. I do. I’ve written about it many times. There are too many smart people building too many crazy things that wouldn’t be possible without this technology for it not to.
  EIP 1559 and Eth2 will Go Through Smoothly. This is certainly a risk, but people seem optimistic.
  Ethereum will remain the main L1 for web3. At this point, Ethereum’s network effects are too strong to overcome. Developers, users, and even other L1s are building on or compatible with Ethereum. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414622886/16483991))

- In sum:
  Ethereum has strong network effects and will remain at the center of the web3 ecosystem as it continues to grow, creating more transactions and more fees
  ETH will become a deflationary asset as demand for it increases
  ETH will become a capital asset that earns holders high APR ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1414622886/16484040))
