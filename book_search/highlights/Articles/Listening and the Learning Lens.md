### Highlights

- Donâ€™t be a crocodile, all mouth and no ears. Choose a learning lens over a lecturing lens. Be aware of the differences between your lenses and those of others. To truly listen to others is a gift to them. Give it with courtesy and humility. The payback is real understanding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqg8q436f0ffgv3v0j373s3a))
