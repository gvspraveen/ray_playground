### Highlights

- For small debts, fostering a culture of constantly making minor improvements to the team’s software as part of the “definition of done” is effective both at driving down debt and improving morale.
  Especially in teams supporting actively developed software that’s been around for 5+ years, there’s probably dozens of these bite-sized improvements available that add up over time. As a side effect, it teaches devs to think “it doesn’t have to be this way” when a debt is discovered rather than default to defeatism.
  I think of the tackling of small debts with a forgiving definition of done as mentioned above is a manifestation of Product respecting the needs of Engineering. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1481153897/18710683))

- I think in the case of large debts, the relationship [between Product and Engineering] is joint discovery of business opportunity. Engineering produces a tech debt reduction proposal that uses ROI units comparable to features, whether to do them is a business decision.
  Tech debt proposals should at minimum include a feasible solution and a return on investment in units that can be used to compare them to features. An example ROI: “by spending 50 engineer hours the team can eliminate 1 engineer hours spent doing a manual repeated tasks we expect to do 100 times this year.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1481153897/18710686))
