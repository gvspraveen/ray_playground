### Highlights

- The very first thing I do when I am starting to read about a new business is to check for basic hygiene factors like –
  Simple business of reasonable size that I can understand (I avoid extremely small companies),
  Zero or low debt on the balance sheet (if some debt, then enough cash generation to repay interest on debt),
  Presence of pricing power that leads to high or better than average return on capital and return on incremental invested capital, and thus a clean balance sheet,
  Management without a shady past (I search Google for that, applying the company’s name plus keywords like ‘scam’, ‘fraud’, ‘cases’, etc.),
  Ample and profitable reinvestment opportunities, and
  Capacity to suffer bad times
  Any business that fails on even one of these parameters is out of my sight in quick time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1502039658/19408402))
