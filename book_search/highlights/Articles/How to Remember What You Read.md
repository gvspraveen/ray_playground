### Highlights

- truths about reading:
  Quality matters more than quantity. If you read one book a month but fully appreciate and absorb it, you’ll be better off than someone who skims half the library without paying attention.
  Speed-reading is bullshit. Getting the rough gist and absorbing the lessons are two different things. Confuse them at your peril.
  Book summary services miss the point. A lot of companies charge ridiculous prices for access to garbled, vague summaries bearing only the faintest resemblance to anything in the book. Summaries can be a useful jumping-off point to explore your curiosity, but you cannot learn from them the way you can from the original text.*
  Fancy apps and tools are not needed. A notebook, index cards, and a pen will do just fine.
  We shouldn’t read stuff we find boring. Life is far too short.
  Finishing the book is optional. You should start a lot of books and only finish a few of them. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1438457610/17256789))
