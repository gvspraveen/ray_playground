- Its financial services offering includes:
  Credit. Paytm offers four credit products in partnership with banks and other financial institutions: merchant credit, short-term consumer loans, co-branded credit cards and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) credit via its wallet. Paytm takes a commission on the origination of loans from its partners, but when it gets its small finance bank license, it will be able to retain loans on its own balance sheet. 
  Funds. Paytm launched Paytm Money in 2018. The app offered funds from 25 mutual fund houses in India, covering 90% of the market. It recently added retail brokerage where it charges zero fees for cash trading and a small flat fee for derivatives trading.
  Gold. Paytm has a partnership with a precious metals refinery, allowing customers to buy, store and sell 24-karat gold. Customers can buy gold for as little as Rs1 and resell it online.
  Insurance. Paytm offers insurance products from over 30 insurers across term life, health, motor insurance, and consumer electronics. Commission rates for insurance distribution are typically quite high, as PolicyBazaar, a standalone online insurance distributor, shows.
