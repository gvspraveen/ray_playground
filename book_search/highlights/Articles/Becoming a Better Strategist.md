### Highlights

- ***Strategy Starts with Customers***
  Use every opportunity to talk to customers — both end-customers and channel (if your business sells through a channel). You don’t have to be at all formal or scientific about it. Make it easy to get started by doing it in a comfortable situation. If you have stores, wander a few of them talking to customers. If you are B2B, tag along with salespeople. Don’t have an agenda. Just soak in the customer thoughts, reactions, and behaviors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gdbv103sapgzz2nqy5zm45rc))

- ***Strategy Involves Operating and Choosing in a Complex Adaptive System***
  This is a bit trickier because this mindset is quite abstract. Here my main goal is to help budding strategists stop beating themselves up for being unable to predict the future with as much accuracy as they think they should be able to achieve. They have all been educated to believe if they just crunch the data, they will be able to make a data-based decision about the future, and because it is data-based, it will be accurate. This is, of course, popular hogwash: complex adaptive systems don’t work that way.
  So, I encourage them to see everything they do as tweaking, watching the results, tweaking, watching, tweaking, etc. That will help them internalize that their choices neither must nor can be perfect, but that is just fine.

- ***Strategy Embraces Inventing the Future***
  To get strategists more comfortable with inventing the future, I encourage the practice of always reverse-engineering the status quo by asking [the most important question in strategy](https://rogermartin.medium.com/what-would-have-to-be-true-83dac5bd2189): What Would Have to be True (WWHTBT)? Most people who follow my strategy methodology will ask WWHTBT with respect to future possibilities — and in doing so unearth the risks that they must counter in order to choose a new possibility. The downside to this otherwise helpful practice is that it can implicitly cause the user to believe future possibilities are riskier than the continuation of the status quo.
  However, if you also ask WWHTBT going forward for the ***status quo choice*** to be sound, you will learn that continuing the status quo is often as risky as shifting to a different strategy possibility. In fact, when I do this with clients, after reverse-engineering it, they often eliminate the status quo because the risk of the things that would have to be true actually being true is so high that inventing the future is obviously less risky.
  Hence, if you make a practice of reverse-engineering the status quo, you will provide yourself the encouragement to invent the future, even if that entails needing to make something true in the future that is not currently true. But that is the highest leverage job of the strategist — to make true something that is currently not true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gdbv3m1mzc7sv65e1jq15vbz))
