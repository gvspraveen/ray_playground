### Highlights

- Facebook story has the following constituent parts:
  1. *Billions of intense users:* If there is one lesson that we should have learned from our experiences with user-based and subscriber-based companies over the last decade, it is that not all users or subscribers are created equal. With Facebook, it is not just the roughly three billion people who are in its ecosystem that should draw your attention, but the amount of time they spend in it. Until TikTok recently supplanted it at the top, Facebook had the most intense user base of any social media platform, with users staying on the platform roughly an hour a day in 2019.
  2. *Sharing personal data in their postings:* As a platform that encourages users to share everything with their "friends", it is undeniable that Facebook has accumulated immense amounts of data about its users. If you are a privacy purist, and you find this unconscionable, it is worth noting that these users were not dragged on to a platform and forced to share their deeply personal thoughts and feelings, against their wishes.
  3. *Which could be utilized to focus advertising at them:* In 2018, at the peak of the Cambridge Analytica scandals, when people were piling on Facebook for its invasion of privacy, I noted invading user privacy, albeit with their tacit approval, lies at the core of Facebook's success in online advertising. In short, Facebook uses what it has learnt about the people inhabiting its platform to focus advertising to them.
  4. *In a world where online ads were consuming the advertising business:* Facebook also benefited from a macro shift in the advertising business, where advertisers were shifting from traditional advertising modes (newspapers, television, billboards etc.) to online advertising; online advertising increased from less than 10% of total advertising in 2005 to close to 60% of total adverting in 2020.
