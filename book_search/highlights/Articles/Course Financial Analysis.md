- I like to look at 2 ratios to determine the healthiness of a balance
  sheet:
  1. Interest coverage
  2. Net debt / free cash flow
  Interest coverage
  This ratio shows you how easily a company can pay back the interests on its outstanding
  debt.
  You can calculate it as follows:
  Interest coverage = (EBIT / Interest payments)
  The higher this ratio, the better. I prefer to invest in company’s with an interest coverage
  of at least 10x.
  Net Debt / Free Cash Flow
  This ratio shows you how many years it would take the company to pay down all its debt
  when it would use all available free cash flow.
  The formula for this ratio is very obvious:
  Net Debt / Free Cash Flow = (Net Debt / Free Cash Flow)
  The lower this ratio, the better. Personally I prefer companies with a Net Debt / Free Cash
  Flow lower than 4. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxgt2z0z5e5004jmgbbr0avt))

- After you’ve taken a look at a company’s cash flow from operations and cash flow from
  investing activities, you can calculate the free cash flow.
  Free cash flow = operating cash flow - CAPEX
  The free cash flow of a company is one of the most important financial metrics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxgvmpe5bh641jfs4fb34m31))
