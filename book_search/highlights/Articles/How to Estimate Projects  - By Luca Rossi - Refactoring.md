### Highlights

- Measuring effort is bad because:
  👥 It depends on the developer — the estimate is bound to the person that is assigned to the task. Junior vs Senior devs might take very different times to complete the same task.
  ⚒️ It depends on other activities — even though you can strive to measure an absolute effort, devs will naturally take into account the time they expect to lose on concurrent activities, like maintenance, meetings, and interruptions.
  🗓️ It turns estimates into deadlines — it comes natural to set deadlines based on the sum of days that come up from estimates. This creates a commitment that is fragile—see (2)—and imprecise, because estimates are rough. It also puts more stress on developers, which may lead to the vicious cycle of inflated estimates.
