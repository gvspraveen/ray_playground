- “The two cardinal problems in investing, trading or professional gambling are (1) Finding a set of profitable opportunities and (2) Sizing your investments/bets. Most professional traders agree that the second problem is the more difficult of the two. Instances of this problem include a blackjack player deciding what percentage of his bankroll to wager on a given hand, a real estate investor deciding how much of her portfolio to commit to a new property, and a derivatives trader deciding what leverage to apply to a new strategy.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1397187905/15872892))
- The patterns of networks show up in everything from human interaction to the spread of diseases or disseminating ideas. What underlies all of those phenomena is that our individual behaviors aggregate through social networks and then cascade to create large-scale societal shifts. By improving our social connections on a personal level, we can make an impact on an organizational or even societal scale. Instead of thinking about networking as a transactional process to get ahead, think of it as a way to build, affirm, and leverage the relationships that matter to you for mutual benefit.
