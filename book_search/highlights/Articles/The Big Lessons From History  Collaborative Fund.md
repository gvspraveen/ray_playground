### Highlights

- One is that everyone has a model in their head of how they think the world works, and that model is built mostly from what you’ve experienced and what people you trust have told you. But since everyone has different experiences and trust a different set of people, the models of how we think things work vary wildly from person to person.

- The Great Depression, for example, was a stock market crash and a banking crash and a real estate bubble and an agricultural disaster and a poor policy response. None of those things on their own were that big a deal. But when they happened at the same time – wham, it was a catastrophe.
  Covid-19 is similar. A virus transferred from animal to humans (has happened forever) and those humans socialized with other people (of course). It was a mystery for a while (small sample size) and then bad news was then likely suppressed (hoping it would soon end). Other countries thought it would be contained (standard denial) and didn’t act fast enough (bureaucracy, lack of leadership). We weren’t prepared (over-optimism) and could only respond with blunt-force lockdowns (do what you gotta do) and panic (calm plants the seeds of crazy).
  Remove just a few of those and 2020 may have looked like a normal year. But they all happened at once, so we got the biggest event of a generation. And it makes answering the question, “How did Covid-19 get this bad” more complicated than we want it to be. The most accurate answer may be something like Richard Whitney’s: Ask the seven billion people on the Planet Earth. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363924457/14659233))
- The biggest risk is what no one sees coming, because if no one sees it coming no one’s prepared for it, and if no one’s prepared for it its damage will be amplified when it arrives. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1363924457/14659250))
