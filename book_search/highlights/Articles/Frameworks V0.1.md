### Highlights

- An Atomic Value Swap is the measurement of the sustainability of repeated core transactions in an ecosystem. Payment for goods or services is an example of an atomic value swap, one where cash is exchanged for an item or service. Both parties deem the transaction to be beneficial and therefore the transaction occurs. If the price of a product or service is too high, the buyer will not engage in the transaction.

- All successful consumer-facing companies appeal to one or more of the seven deadly sins. They are time-tested core motivators that incentivize people to do things (the fact that they have survived for all of time without any edits is proof of their power). There are no successful consumer companies that do not appeal to any of the seven deadly sins.
  Different motivators can apply to different constituents within each company, even different behaviors from the same constituent.
  Examples:
  Pride: Instagram, Tik Tok
  Sloth: Uber, Amazon
  Gluttony: DoorDash, Instacart
  Wrath: Twitter
  Envy: Pinterest
  Lust: Tinder, OnlyFans
  Greed: Bitcoin, Robinhood ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383238192/15364775))

- SUPPLY AS COMMODITY VS. SUPPLY AS UNIQUE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES
  Treating supply as a commodity is the core philosophy of all marketplaces. This leads to supply competing to serve the firehose of demand with that competitive dynamic translating into a consumer surplus. Treating supply as unique is the classic “arm the rebels” approach which requires the supply to think of themselves as non-fungible. Supply that believes itself not to be a commodity will invest in products that allow themselves to differentiate from competitors, capture more margin from their customers, and avoid being platform dependent.
  Examples:
  Uber is an excellent example of supply as commodity. Interestingly enough, I explicitly wouldn’t want the same driver as I had last time because in all likelihood, they are very far away when I need them. Shopify is a great example of supply as unique. No company using Shopify thinks of themselves as a commodity, which is exactly why they invest the time and energy into setting up their own storefront rather than plugging into a marketplace with pre-existing demand.

- DISTRIBUTION VS. MONETIZATION
  Platforms focus on offering the supply side of their ecosystem either distribution or monetization. Those that focus on a combination of both will be challenged by the specialized vs. generalized dynamic over time.
  Examples:
  Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok offer pure distribution. No constituents on the platforms receive any monetary payment for their participation, incentivized only by the prospect of building an audience and engagement. Shopify and Patreon offer pure monetization. No customer of Shopify or Patreon expects to increase their distribution simply by being on the platform. The main value proposition is in the monetization of pre-existing distribution. YouTube and Twitch are good examples of platforms that offer both distribution and monetization. Rather than being the best of both worlds, over time, it is often the case that they offer the worst of both worlds, leading the supply side to multi-home across distribution platforms and turn to more effective monetization tools.

- Don’t be surprised when people do things they’re incentivized to do. Don’t expect people to do anything they are not incentivized to do.
  [The design of incentives within a system governs the flow of user behavior. In the same way that it is impossible to flow water uphill, no party will do anything that they are not incentivized to do.] ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383238192/15364863))

- Marketplaces generally take 20% of every transaction that occurs on the platform. Why has the invisible hand determined that 20% is the correct take rate for marketplaces? It’s important to understand the alternative to marketplaces and what they offer to the supply-side, which typically bears the cost of the fee rather than the demand-side. The marketplace offers pre-existing demand to incremental supply. A would-be supplier on a marketplace can rest assured that if they put their correctly-priced goods or services on a liquid market that demand will show up and transact. It’s not unusual for companies to spend approximately 20% of their top line revenue on marketing, which is essentially demand generation. If the supplier were to outsource all of their demand generation to a single entity, that entity would be entitled to collect what would otherwise have been spent, or about 20% ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383238192/15380221))
- A SPECIALIZED TOOL WILL ALWAYS BEAT A GENERALIZED TOOL OVER TIME ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383238192/15380325))
- Correct instincts compound time savings.
  [For every instinct that a decision maker understands and foregoes an experiment to acquire information, that decision maker saves the amount of time and work that an uninformed decision maker would have to expend to possess the same information. This has a continual compounding effect and the origin of “founder-market fit.” Founders who have more empathy or correct instincts are able to execute significantly faster.] ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1383238192/15380589))
