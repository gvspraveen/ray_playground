### Highlights

- Because most people don’t see them, breaking through an existing paradigm needs to provide enough compelling value for users to disrupt an old paradigm. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1372517241/14950520))

- Entrepreneurs innovate and “create” value for society — and that value gained by society also often “destroys” the former monopoly power. That process and its importance is at the centre of how all modern economies have evolved and given rise to most of the benefits to society we take for granted today. New winners become so valuable that they disrupt existing market power or structures. It is all driven from a near constant flow of innovative entrepreneurs with bold ideas and the capital backing them that go up against the status quo and are only successful, “if’’ they create value for society.

- I believe with what is to come, Bitcoin has a higher than average probability of overcoming all barriers and becoming a global reserve currency. More importantly, I believe it gives humanity its’ best chance for a peaceful transition to the future. A world where the abundance gained from our technological progress is more widely distributed. It is not hyperbole to say that almost everything changes as a result of this innovation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1372517241/14950564))

- For a challenger to continue to advance then, it must continue to offer more advantage than the copycats while staying under the radar from the monopoly for enough time to gain enough scale or gain “network effects” before the monopoly takes notice. The best way to do this — is not by competing on everything that a monopoly competes on, but instead, picking a very small part of a market that goes relatively unnoticed by the monopoly and providing the 10x advantage to only that.

- Bitcoins first use case could then be viewed more of a store of value, than a currency since for it to compete as a currency, it would need to be able to be used widely in society. In other words, Bitcoin’s narrow 10x advantage could be compared to Gold first, rather than as a competitor to money. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1372517241/14950585))
- The new policy makers will change the rules, effectively transferring the independence of the FED and other Central Banks, to Treasury and politicians to allow for a redistribution of wealth in an attempt to save the system.
  This will first come in the way of Modern Monetary Theory, helicopter drops of money and other fiscal programs designed to get newly printed money to citizens and businesses in an attempt to avoid unrest, and to spur inflation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1372517241/14950749))
- Along this path we can also expect certain Governments make it more difficult for Bitcoin (or other Challengers) to compete by closing onramps/offramps or making their own digital currencies appear more attractive. While the existing Monopoly may not provide the same security as a store of value, (the Challenger’s first 10x advantage) it does currently provide a far simpler way to transact with the greater economy. Certain governments will use that advantage to slow or stop the Challengers’ advance into a wider medium of exchange.
  Fortunately, by doing so, it also creates an incentive for other governments, economies and businesses to accept Bitcoin (the Challenger) either as a currency itself or as a unit of account backing their own currency. While these actions are likely to have short-term implications on Bitcoin (the Challenger), they likely also serve to reinforce the Challengers position.

- s this network effect continues, eventually each country in the existing system (monopoly) will face an important choice.
  The existing system can either:
  Start to embrace the challenger (Bitcoin) and start accumulating it on their own for an eventual peg to their own currency. Which will only serve to increase the velocity of the challenger’s “network effect” and cause others to do so as well. This means early adopting countries, like the people, and the companies before them, have a larger benefit as the price moves higher because of increased trust and competition for its utility as a store of value. If this were to happen, Bitcoin’s 10x advantage as a store of value would be cemented but its innovation and advancement to the rest of the economy would probably stop there. The onramps and offramps to individual currencies would continue to function within governments which would be pegged to Bitcoin. Or
  Attempt to stop it. (To do so, it would require a coordinated fashion since individual countries trying to stop Bitcoin’s advance would lead back to #1 by creating an additional incentive for early adopting countries). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1372517241/14950851))
- The “perception” of scarcity 1) that education from the best schools is required to have a great career, and 2) there are only a limited of spaces available in those schools, 3) means the cost and competition for those spaces is constantly rising, which the system reinforces without us even questioning it (our self-imposed prison). That same “perceived scarcity” creates an education system that increases inequality because access to education — and along with it, the best jobs — becomes more about an ability to pay, than curiosity and drive.
