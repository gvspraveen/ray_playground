### Highlights

- To its credit, breakfast does get your kid’s brain going in the morning. It increases the thermic effect of food, which is worth about 10 percent of your energy expenditure, and it suppresses ghrelin (the hunger hormone) so you won’t overeat at lunch. But for children, it’s easy to turn to what is fast and cheap, and what they can pour themselves. Cold cereal. Instant oatmeal. Granola bars. Protein bars. Yogurt smoothies. All marketed to kids and their parents and all laden with sugar. Consider Raisin Bran. Just raisins and bran, right? There are 16 grams of sugar in a serving, but the raisins only account for 8. That’s because the raisins are all dipped in a sugar solution (they’re white, not purple—see the book jacket cover!) to make them much sweeter. And if you think Cracklin’ Oat Bran or Honey Bunches of Oats are any healthier, think again. The food industry knows how to market to kids—sports figures, celebrities, characters and mascots, cartoons, premiums, cross-promotion toys, collectibles, kids’ clubs, internet games, and contests.

- Dietary sugar is composed of two molecules: glucose and fructose. Fructose, while an energy source (4 kcal/gram), is otherwise vestigial to humans; again, there’s no biochemical reaction that requires it. However, fructose is metabolized in the liver in exactly the same way as alcohol. That’s why, when consumed chronically and in high doses, fructose is similarly toxic and abused, unrelated to its calories or effects on weight. That’s why our children now get the diseases of alcohol (Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease), without ever taking a drink. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1433587797/17098002))
