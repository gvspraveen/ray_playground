### Highlights

- Whatever the US’s advantage is, it’s very abstract if it applies to the soda you drink, the way you pay for it, the store where you buy it, the company whose ads reminded you to drink it, and the company whose medication helps your body cope with a lifetime of excess high-fructose corn syrup consumption.

- US outperformance a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Venture capitalists are eager to fund American companies because they know that those companies can be worth a lot when they IPO, and will have access to enough talent to get to the point where an IPO is possible. Founders want to start companies here in part because this is where they’ll be able to get them funded and find employees. So the money is chasing the talent (and money), and the talent is chasing the money (and the rest of the talent). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1372466428/14948897))
- the S&P outperforms because of companies like Google and Facebook, and those companies are part of that index because of prior outperformance. Momentum, as a trading signal, has been measured across asset classes, countries, and time periods; like many other systematic signals, we can confidently say it’s universal and much less confidently say that it represents something real. This doesn’t make it invincible by any means. Momentum as a trading signal has had painful drawdowns during its history, and those drawdowns been hard to predict in advance. And many populists who are skeptical of the free flow of people, goods, and capital are perfectly happy with an outcome where those flows diminish and the largest US companies lose much of their value. But, barring any sweeping change to policy, it’s hard to change this dynamic. People and money are sides of a two-sided market, and dominant players in two-sided markets tend to grow their lead over time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1372466428/14948907))
- as Facebook matures, a) the cost of operating the service, to someone at sub-Facebook scale, has risen, and b) the network of advertisers matters relatively more, since that’s what has allowed Facebook to keep growing revenue even as user and usage growth decelerate. The only companies that could acquire advertisers at remotely similar scale would be the same companies that are worrying about antitrust action of their own. A company’s costs are a sum, but its revenues are a product, and if one term of that product is much smaller, the overall output is smaller and the entire business is uneconomic.
