### Highlights

- The Hindu-Indian uncle in Houston will cheer for Trump’s Islam-baiting quite shutting out the fact that to Trump and many of his supporters, he is no different; that while he may want to be distinguished from the other minority, the majority clubs them together ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1359604875/14521005))
- So while Trump’s public posturing has been on illegal immigration, because that is what the Trump’s base cares for, the actual policy changes have been on legal immigration. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1359604875/14521018))
- The last few years has seen the US administration not just limit legal immigration, but humiliating and inconveniencing, in every possible, legal guest workers in high-skilled industries, based on pure caprice. And yet, and this is where individual behavior bucks group-think, many of these very same people, at the receiving end of the serrated blade-edge of Trump’s vision for the US, show up to Trump rallies and abuse other Indians online who are anti-Trump ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1359604875/14521025))
- he will show up to a Howdy Modi rally, but it’s because of what he is getting out of it, in terms of stroking his sense of ego. He doesn’t care who strokes it, Imran Khan, or North Korea, or Putin or China or Stormy Daniels. With Trump, like everything else, his racism and xenophobia is subject to negotiation.

- Once you associate the worst with someone, what else does that person have left to prove? One of the foundational aspects of any cult is to convince the cult members that the world is against them, and that all they have is each other, and Trump doesn’t even need to do it, the New York Times and Washington Post and Huffington Post does it for him.

- As the US moves towards an extremist philosophy of socialism, fuelled by the cult of AOC and Bernie and Ilhan Omar, Trump, the extremist, is seen as the biggest and most steadfast agent who can be expected to stand against this drastic change ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1359604875/14521157))
- If you hear “defund the police”, you are not going to listen to “But hey this doesn’t exactly mean what it says,” the provocative three words are enough to drive you into the arms of the “law and order” President, even though the President himself is so “law and order” that he has been found to be skimming off his own charity.

- It was because he was up against him Joe Biden. Joe Biden represents the last generation of centrist Democrats, who has kept himself out of culture and political wars. His critics among progressives would say that he is but a kinder version of Trump, in that he represents the same old traditional “white male” identity and has a problematic history with women, not just the personal accusations against him, but also his behavior during the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearing ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1359604875/14521187))
- If there is anything that history has taught us, from Robespierre and the Reign of Terror to Trump 2020, is that the way to defeat extremism is not extremism. Quite the opposite in fact. It is to eschew the ideological purity that extremists demand in favor of workability, the art of the deal ironically, to compromise, to go to the center, to realize that just like people, nations are flawed, but that does not make them bad or irredeemable, that cancel culture is nothing more than the power of the mob to silence, that people need to be engaged with rather than be asked to step back and shut up, that men and women are not merely dumb elements of a set but a complex juxtaposition of personal histories and group memberships.
