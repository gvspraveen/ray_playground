### Highlights

- Pre-mortems are popular and useful in engineering as well. As you work on a tech design, you can ask questions to address common issues before they actually happen:
  Project running late â€” what could cause us to miss our deadline?
  Technical Debt â€” what changes to requirements would make this design obsolete in the future? (see technical debt as disagreement)
  Build the wrong thing â€” are there any requirements missing?
  Scaling and reliability issues â€” are we creating any bottlenecks or single points of failure? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1421681969/16715073))
- If you are looking for solutions to a problem, try to start with the worst you can imagine. Literally, those that either make the problem worse, or solve it at the expense of creating much bigger issues.
  Bad solutions provide tons of insights and make it easier to work your way towards the good ones. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1421681969/16715076))
