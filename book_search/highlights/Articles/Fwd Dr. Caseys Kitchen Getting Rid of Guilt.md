### Highlights

- When we eat, we are literally constructing our bodies, so it is crucial to focus more on what you include in your diet to help build your body, rather than on what you restrict. 
  Food is molecular information for my body. The average person eats three to four pounds of food per day. That is three to four pounds of chemical instructions that our cells and genes are “reading” to know what to do. Good instructions lead to health; flawed or incomplete instructions lead to disease and suffering. A constructive mindset focuses on how much positive molecular information you can get in your body in a day. Eating this way can even be a fun challenge: Every day is a micronutrient, omega-3, fiber, antioxidant, and phytonutrient hunt! ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1460833222/18008463))

- In the complex system of your body, single events, like a poor night of sleep or a glucose spike, have little effect on long-term outcomes, so they’re not worth stressing about. (Stress could actually be more damaging to health than the single dietary “transgression.”) 
  Trends over time are what matters. Your body is remarkably adaptable. It knows how to use hormones like insulin to deal with a glucose spike or antioxidants to fight the damage from a fructose-filled soda. It’s when we repeatedly stress our bodies, day after day, that these systems can become overwhelmed and start to break down, leading to insulin resistance or chronic inflammation. Single events like a glucose spike are incredibly valuable, however. They are direct feedback on how a particular food or lifestyle choice affects our glucose—information we can carry into future decisions to avoid negative trends over time. Look at an event as a gift, not a reason to feel guilt.
  Eating a food we know isn’t great for us can feel like a failure. But it’s crucial to remember that it’s the sum of our behaviors—diet, sleep, stress, exercise—over time that determine our state of health. This is why we focus on our trends, like a continuous glucose data stream. The single event carries less meaning ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1460833222/18008480))
