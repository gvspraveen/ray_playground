### Highlights

- It’s common to find someone who bought their home in, say, 1974, for something like $60,000. Today it’s worth perhaps $350,000. The owners no doubt feel they have made the investment of their lives.
  But those numbers above equate to an average annual return of 3.75%. Property taxes tend to average roughly 1%, so that brings our real return to 2.75% per year. Maintenance and repairs vary greatly, but spending 1% - 3% of your home’s value per year on upkeep should be expected.
  Where does that leave our long-term returns? Ah, quite dim.
  Price is easy to calculate. It’s just whatever you paid initially and sold for eventually.
  Cost is harder to figure out. They tend to be a slow drip over time, which are easy to ignore but add up quickly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gps4y4vajnmq19zma6rdpw7j))
