### Highlights

- “Principles and processes provide us with a systemic and scalable way of repeating the behaviors that we strongly believe will lead to positive outcomes, and help us to avoid repeating past mistakes”

- three key types of processes that have consistently helped us to scale and deliver on our goals. These are:
  Processes that improve the quality of our execution and manage how we build, support, and evolve systems to our expected standard.
  Processes that help support our people and aim to increase their engagement and growth. These processes are often neglected by smaller companies and need to be implemented early as they can be messy, costly, and unethical if mismanaged.
  Processes that help align the business and your ability to deliver common goals like a desired customer outcome, revenue goals, or business sustainability targets.

- Implementation of an effective process in your organization can fail because:
  People don’t follow it. There is no accountability for its implementation. Some people might not even know that the process exists, while others may find it unnecessary and believe it impedes their ability to do their job.
  People follow it but are frustrated and resent the process. The process may not resolve a problem they care about. For others, it may resolve the issue in a different way to how they would like to see it fixed; and so the perceived cost of the compromise outweighs the benefit of following the process.
  It’s a bad solution to your problem or it’s unnecessarily prescriptive. This is particularly troublesome as it can stifle much-needed innovation and autonomy among teams (yikes!), leading to unchallenged and blindly followed assumptions. Even worse, this particular barricade can inadvertently encode people’s biases into established ways of working, which can create systemic issues.
