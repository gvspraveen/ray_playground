### Highlights

- On healthy teams, readability is the result of many practices, like:
  • **Good separation of responsibilities** — to keep code *simple.*
  • **Meaningful folder structures** — to make code *discoverable.*
  • **Good naming conventions** — to make code *understandable.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg0e8ygf45q4zte7mbjt7zeg))

- good systems form virtuous cycles:
  1. **Great tests** catch errors before they become problems.
  2. Tests require a **structure that affords the time** and space to write them.
  3. That structure exists because engineers are **comfortable speaking up** when they need extra time to get the tests right.
  4. Engineers are comfortable speaking up because they work in an environment with **high psychological safety**.
  5. That environment exists in part because failures are seen as systemic, and **individuals won’t be punished**, blamed, or shamed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gg0ebakaybabjnvw7vmmnkkw))
