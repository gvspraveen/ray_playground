### Highlights

- So now putting this all together, the assumptions that computing would be defined by increasing gigahertz (power), many generic cores (not graphics), discrete connectivity (WWAN chips), and no small form factor SoC and you can see how disruption happens.

- But businesses are made of 4 P’s (product, price, place, promotion) and disruption almost always reaches a tipping point at go to market. That’s the last topic.
  Too often in disruption, us techies focus on the product. In my view, it is almost always the go to market where the actual disruption happens. That is because even when a company might have a product that can enter a “new” market and compete the problem is the new market almost always means less revenue and/or profit so it basically looks like self-destruction. And keep in mind, it isn’t like the company is actually seeing the impact of this new platform in revenue.
  Ultimately, Intel chips are expensive. On an average PC, Intel might charge $125 for the CPU/mobo (depending on how much of Intel stuff is bought). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1374103518/15017448))
- if innovation is focused on first and foremost being proprietary vs solving problems people have, then I think you’ll always run into trouble.
  In an “ecosystem” play this is always a risk. Ppl hate being locked in, especially when it is obviously the intent.
  Everyone is ultimately proprietary even in the Open Source world. Once you invest heavily in any sort of architecture or platform, you’re not moving anywhere with your current investment. That said, no one likes to hear about potential investments knowing that the whole point is to be proprietary versus solving some core problem. Solutions in search of problems can often feel that way, especially if by “chance” they drive a wedge with a platform competitor. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1374103518/15018680))
